A lack of automated software testing, combined with too many manual tests conducted too late in the process, was a story told time after time, and it certainly was one without any kind of happy ending.\nDespite the undeniable progress DevOps has brought to software development, integrating automated software testing into the lifecycle has remained an elusive goal for many teams. Here’s a look at why testing is such a difficult step to get right, and how an integrated DevOps Platform can bring much-needed structure to the process.\nThe state of automated software testing\nAccording to our 2021 Survey, it’s safe to say respondents are frustrated with software test…",

Because Pouya and the team at QPage had already used GitLab at a previous employer, they knew it would be the right fit.
