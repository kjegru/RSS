          "description": "Cloud native application architectures use containerization, microservices, and Kubernetes to run reliably at cloud-scale. With a built-in container registry and Kubernetes integration, GitLab is the best way to develop and deploy cloud native applications. GitLab version 14.1 also includes a Helm registry, which allows users to publish, install, and share Helm charts and packages from within our single application for the entire DevOps lifecycle.\nWhat is Helm?\nHelm is a package manager for Kubernetes. A Chart is a Helm package that contains the resource definitions required to run an application inside a Kubernetes cluster. Helm allows you to manage complex applications by storing the application definition in a chart that can be versioned, shared, and collaborated on.\nThe differences bet…",

In this second blog post, we'll dig deep into how to use a push-based approach. The agentless approach may be preferable for situations with non-Kubernetes infrastructure components or when you don't want to install, run, and maintain agents in each infrastructure component for GitOps. In this post, we will discuss how the scripting capabilities of GitLab can be used in GitOps workflows, and how to use predefined GitLab variables to shape infrastructure components.\nAbout a push-based or agentless approach\nWith the agentless approach, infrastructure expressed and managed as code on GitLab, and updates and drift detection are automated and handled by GitLab without having to install any agents o…",

No matter the\nprogramming task at hand, chances are there is a package in a public registry\nsuch as rubygems.org or npmjs.com that implements that task.\nWhile the reuse of publicly available packages reduces the time necessary to write an app, this reuse\nbrings its own set of challenges. Apps quickly depend on hundreds of packages,\nand programmers often simply just trust that these packages don't contain malicious code.\nIn an ideal world, all depended-upon code is thoroughly vetted before being included in a program – however, this is often unfeasible in practice due to the sheer amount of dependency code that needs to be reviewed and the lack of existing tools to help with vetting dependency code.\nMalicious code in the wild…",

So, how do we describe the major phenomenon in Ops over the past 20 years?\nBefore 2000, the primary approach to operations was to hire a System Administrator or empower Lead Developers to do Ops work. System Administrators knew a lot about networking and server optimisations, and a good sysadmin can do most of their work through code, using Bash, Perl or Python scripts.

While it can apply to nearly any established or new procedure, it seems to most often get applied to software.

          "description": "GitLab uses a GPG key to sign all Omnibus packages created within the CI pipelines to insure that the packages have not been tampered with. This key is seperate from the repository metadata signing key used by package managers and the GPG signing key for the GitLab Runner. The Omnibus package signing key is set to expire on July 1, 2021 and will be extended to expire on July 1, 2022 instead.\nWhy are we extending the deadline?\nThe Omnibus package signing key's expiration is extended each year to comply with GitLab security policies and to limit the exposure should the key become compromised. The key's expiration is extended instead of rotating to a new key to be less disruptive for users that do verify package integrity checks prior to installing the package.\nWhat do I need to do?\nThe only action that needs to be taken is to update your copy of the package signing key if you validate the signatures on the Omnibus packages that GitLab distributes.\nThe package signing key is not the key that signs the repository metadata used by the OS package managers like apt or yum. Unless you are specifically verifying the package signatures or have configured your package manager to verify the package signatures, there is no action needed on your part to continue installing Omnibus packages.\nMore information concerning verification of the package signatures\nis available in the Omnibus documentation. If you just need to refresh a copy\nof the public key, then you can find it on any of the GPG keyservers by\nsearching for support@gitlab.com or using the key ID of\nDBEF 8977 4DDB 9EB3 7D9F  C3A0 3CFC F9BA F27E AB47. Alternatively you could\ndownload it directly from packages.gitlab.com using the URL:\nhttps://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/nightly-builds/gpgkey/gitlab-nightly-builds-3D645A26AB9FBD22.pub.gpg\n\n\nWhat do I do if I still have problems?\nPlease open an issue in the omnibus-gitlab issue tracker.",
