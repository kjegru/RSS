          "description": "Threat modeling is more common in people’s everyday lives than they might think.  Each of us performs some level of threat modeling every time we’re in a situation where we’re evaluating threats. An everyday example I really like: crossing the street. Before we cross the street we look both ways, we evaluate the speed of each oncoming vehicle and verify the driver has seen us. Finally, if the lights are green, we cross the street. This is threat modeling!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about what threat modeling is and how we’re developing our threat model here at GitLab, you can read about “How we’re creating a threat model framework that works for GitLab“ by my teammate Mark Loveless.\nThreat modeling IRL\nIn this blog post I’ll talk about how we put our threat modeling process into…",

Today, it’s an entirely different world: DevOps is increasingly mainstream and there's a DevOps platform revolution.\nWe didn’t have a crystal ball back then, but we did try to create a product, a culture and a company that reflected what we thought mattered most. Here’s a look back at 10 key decisions we made that still have impact:\nWork in parallel: When we started, it was clear the waterfall method of software development - where one stage waited on another stage and nothing happened independently - slowed everything. We decided right from the beginning that a “work in parallel” philosophy would be fundamental to our culture and our behaviors.

          "description": "GitLab has been working on a process to intentionally limit our own ability to identify individual users from Service Usage Data in order to protect user privacy even better. Earlier this year, we solicited input on plans to de-identify GitLab’s Service Usage Data. We are now ready to move forward with a new system to de-identify SaaS usage data before it enters GitLab’s internal analytics environment.\nWhat isn’t changing?\nThe service usage data policy for SaaS and Self-Managed remains unchanged.\nWhat is changing?\nWith user privacy in mind, we are building a pseudonymization process to run against our SaaS service usage data.\nWe have determined that we do not need fully identifiable information anymore for our analytics environment, and as such we are pursuing this approach that will result in better privacy for GitLab users.\nWe’ll create a one-way hash or transform directly identifiable data. This means that the data will be hashed at the collection layer before it is sent to our analytics environment.\nYou can read more details about our pseudonymization solution here. Once our pseudonymization solution is in place, we will update data we collect to ensure it follows the  solution. You can read more about what data we collect and its de-identification state here.\nTimeline and implementation\nWe’re planning to roll out these changes in October 2021. Keep an eye on our Product Intelligence roadmap to monitor our progress. Once complete, we’ll update this blog post with the final status.\nMore information\nPlease find more information about our privacy policy. Further details on how service usage data is used for product improvement can be found on our Product Direction page.
