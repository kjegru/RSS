This bug affects any instance running GitLab version 9.3 to version 13.12.3, and was patched in 13.12.4.\nWhat does this mean for existing users?\nThis issue does not affect customers who have disabled Usage Ping via the user interface or any users of our SaaS product.\nYou can check your instance configuration settings to see if this issue may have affected you. We‚Äôve published more detailed instructions here.\nWhat should I do?\nSince we do not collect any configuration data from your instance, we have no way to detect if you unintentionally shared data with GitLab. Out of an abundance of caution, we ask that you fill out this form if you suspect that Usage Ping data was shared after taking steps to opt-out in your GitLab configuration file.

At GitLab, we have a strong point of view on this: DevSecOps places security in the middle of the DevOps effort, which is where it rightly belongs. While transparent and a natural part of the process, it should be top of mind and not buried. Security needs to be everyone‚Äôs responsibility. With automation of processes and policies, it can be much easier to arm developers and security pros alike with the information they need in order to meet this responsibility.\nOur DevSecOps platform is the end-to-end secure software solution that helps you plan, create, deploy, secure, and manage your modern software and the infrastructure upon which it relies.
