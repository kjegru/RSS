          "description": "One of the cybersecurity keywords for 2021 will undoubtedly be \"software supply chain attacks\". For decades, we've seen a global move toward connected systems and highly complex supply chains. Today these supply chains are under attack, with malicious actors jeopardizing the sensitive data of millions of users through attacks on the public and private sectors.\nAfter public and federal entities were targeted in some high-profile supply chain attacks, the United States government released an executive order with plans to improve the security posture of the nation when it comes to software supply chains. The UK issued a similar call for views on cybersecurity in supply chains around the same time.\nSupply chain security became a global priority after the SolarWinds attack, reminding businesses…",

          "description": "Modern programming ecosystems make code reuse exceptionally easy. No matter the\nprogramming task at hand, chances are there is a package in a public registry\nsuch as rubygems.org or npmjs.com that implements that task.\nWhile the reuse of publicly available packages reduces the time necessary to write an app, this reuse\nbrings its own set of challenges. Apps quickly depend on hundreds of packages,\nand programmers often simply just trust that these packages don't contain malicious code.\nIn an ideal world, all depended-upon code is thoroughly vetted before being included in a program – however, this is often unfeasible in practice due to the sheer amount of dependency code that needs to be reviewed and the lack of existing tools to help with vetting dependency code.\nMalicious code in the wild…",
