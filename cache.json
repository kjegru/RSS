          "description": "GitOps is a hot topic in the world of operations, but what does it provide to workflows that we didn‚Äôt have already? Looking at the evolution of the operations space, there have been many big changes in the past 20 years, and I argue that GitOps is not a change, rather a summary of best practices. So, how do we describe the major phenomenon in Ops over the past 20 years?\nBefore 2000, the primary approach to operations was to hire a System Administrator or empower Lead Developers to do Ops work. System Administrators knew a lot about networking and server optimisations, and a good sysadmin can do most of their work through code, using Bash, Perl or Python scripts. While every software engineer likely knows at least the basics of shell scripting, even many backend engineers would not be comf‚Ä¶",

As usual, we‚Äôre doing things a bit differently, but when you hear why it will make a lot of sense.\nThreat modeling\nLet‚Äôs start with the basics, what is threat modeling?\nThreat modeling is the process of risk assessment for a particular project, asset, procedure, or product. While it can apply to nearly any established or new procedure, it seems to most often get applied to software. For GitLab, this would mainly apply to our source code.\nAs assessing risk has historically been the domain of the security department of most organizations, the threat modeling process has been nearly exclusively ha‚Ä¶",

          "description": "GitLab uses a GPG key to sign all Omnibus packages created within the CI pipelines to insure that the packages have not been tampered with. This key is seperate from the repository metadata signing key used by package managers and the GPG signing key for the GitLab Runner. The Omnibus package signing key is set to expire on July 1, 2021 and will be extended to expire on July 1, 2022 instead.\nWhy are we extending the deadline?\nThe Omnibus package signing key's expiration is extended each year to comply with GitLab security policies and to limit the exposure should the key become compromised. The key's expiration is extended instead of rotating to a new key to be less disruptive for users that do verify package integrity checks prior to installing the package.\nWhat do I need to do?\nThe only action that needs to be taken is to update your copy of the package signing key if you validate the signatures on the Omnibus packages that GitLab distributes.\nThe package signing key is not the key that signs the repository metadata used by the OS package managers like apt or yum. Unless you are specifically verifying the package signatures or have configured your package manager to verify the package signatures, there is no action needed on your part to continue installing Omnibus packages.\nMore information concerning verification of the package signatures\nis available in the Omnibus documentation. If you just need to refresh a copy\nof the public key, then you can find it on any of the GPG keyservers by\nsearching for support@gitlab.com or using the key ID of\nDBEF 8977 4DDB 9EB3 7D9F  C3A0 3CFC F9BA F27E AB47.

CI/CD pipelines help isolate the impact of potential errors, making it easier to fix them. Top that with a tool that provides effective visibility into the running tasks and there you have a recipe for success.\nSince the primary purpose of CI/CD pipelines is to speed up the development process and provide value to the end user faster, there's always room to make the process more efficient. This blog post unpacks some strategies that can help you get the most out of your pipeline definition in GitLab CI.\nHow Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) enable concurrent pipelines\n\nBy using the \"Needs\" keyword you can define dependencies for jobs that need to be used from previous sta‚Ä¶",
