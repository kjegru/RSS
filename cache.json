          "description": "Spam and abuse are a very real concern for us at GitLab – and likely every company providing services at scale. That's why our Trust and Safety team works hard every day to detect, mitigate, and lessen the effects of spam. Back in October 2020, the GitLab Security team detailed some of the ways they combat spam and abuse and referenced new approaches we were developing and testing to help us better detect and prevent spam.\nWe're excited to introduce Spamcheck, our new anti-spam engine. Spamcheck has been enabled for all projects on GitLab.com, which runs 14.1, and will be included in the 14.2 release for GitLab self-managed coming on August 22.\nThis tool was designed, tested and integrated by our GitLab Security Automation team (with amazing partnership from our Trust and Safety team and o…",

          "description": "One of the cybersecurity keywords for 2021 will undoubtedly be \"software supply chain attacks\". For decades, we've seen a global move toward connected systems and highly complex supply chains. Today these supply chains are under attack, with malicious actors jeopardizing the sensitive data of millions of users through attacks on the public and private sectors.\nAfter public and federal entities were targeted in some high-profile supply chain attacks, the United States government released an executive order with plans to improve the security posture of the nation when it comes to software supply chains. The UK issued a similar call for views on cybersecurity in supply chains around the same time.\nSupply chain security became a global priority after the SolarWinds attack, reminding businesses…",

Through each of these stages, the human mind obtains new knowledge while building and modifying memories to inform one's understanding of the world around them.\nIn the same way that people go through stages as they grow, markets and industries also go through stages of development.

          "description": "In part one of our GitOps series, we described how to use a pull-based (or agent-based) approach. In this second blog post, we'll dig deep into how to use a push-based approach. The agentless approach may be preferable for situations with non-Kubernetes infrastructure components or when you don't want to install, run, and maintain agents in each infrastructure component for GitOps. In this post, we will discuss how the scripting capabilities of GitLab can be used in GitOps workflows, and how to use predefined GitLab variables to shape infrastructure components.\nAbout a push-based or agentless approach\nWith the agentless approach, infrastructure expressed and managed as code on GitLab, and updates and drift detection are automated and handled by GitLab without having to install any agents o…",

No matter the\nprogramming task at hand, chances are there is a package in a public registry\nsuch as rubygems.org or npmjs.com that implements that task.\nWhile the reuse of publicly available packages reduces the time necessary to write an app, this reuse\nbrings its own set of challenges. Apps quickly depend on hundreds of packages,\nand programmers often simply just trust that these packages don't contain malicious code.\nIn an ideal world, all depended-upon code is thoroughly vetted before being included in a program – however, this is often unfeasible in practice due to the sheer amount of dependency code that needs to be reviewed and the lack of existing tools to help with vetting dependency code.\nMalicious code in the wild…",
