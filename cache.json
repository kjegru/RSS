One important process that was slowing the business down – localizing their app.\nLocalization is a key way to drive growth and accelerate product adoption. When done poorly, localization or l10n, as it's commonly known, can slow down your development process, introduce bugs, and make it cumbersome to launch updates. When done right, teams can smooth out the process and continuously localize their app. We unpack how Weet conquered its localization problems using GitLab and Lokalize.\nWhat is Weet?\nWeet is an asynchronous video communication tool designed to reduce the need for meetings.

Given the high stakes involved, we've made some key additions to our DevOps Platform that focus on making the code review process as seamless and effective as possible. We believe the number one way to make code reviews effective is to provide context. Too often we think of code reviews as only \"reading\" and commenting on others' code - but what a good code reviewer does is understand the entire context of the proposed change.

Just managing the backbone of DevOps – the toolchain -– has been a grind.

          "description": "GitLab CI/CD technology has historically divided a pipeline into stages based on the typical development workflow. Now that GitLab 14.2 has launched, users can speed up cycle times by using the needs command to write a complete CI/CD pipeline with every job in the single stage. In fact, you can omit stages completely and have a \"stageless\" pipeline that executes entirely based on the needs dependencies.\nUnderstanding stages\nIn GitLab CI/CD, you use stages to group jobs based on the development workflow and control the order of execution for CI/CD jobs.\nPipelines execute each stage in order, where all jobs in a single stage run in parallel. After a stage completes, the pipeline moves on to execute the next stage and runs those jobs, and the process continues like this until the pipeline com…",
