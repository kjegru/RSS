          "description": "This is the second in a series of blog posts looking at the challenges of code review and the ways a DevOps platform can help. Read the first post.\nCode review can be one of the most deceivingly difficult things in delivering software faster. Given the high stakes involved, we've made some key additions to our DevOps Platform that focus on making the code review process as seamless and effective as possible. We believe the number one way to make code reviews effective is to provide context. Too often we think of code reviews as only \"reading\" and commenting on others' code - but what a good code reviewer does is understand the entire context of the proposed change. Context-driven code reviews should include factors like the issue that spurred on the change, how the change impacts non-obvio…",

In our 2021 Global DevSecOps Survey we asked respondents what their DevOps practices included and a \"DevOps platform\" was among the top four choices, right next to CI/CD, test automation, and DevSecOps.\nWe're of course bullish on the idea of a DevOps platform, but we're far from alone.

Semgrep is a language-agnostic SAST tool that is gaining popularity in CI/CD environments.\nBefore replacing an analyzer with the corresponding Semgrep configuration (called rule-sets), we need to ensure that they are equivalent – in that they yield the same set of findings.\nFor this purpose, we built a testing framework that helps us assess the quality of a Semgrep rule-set.

It’s a painful journey we see again and again when we meet new customers. It spans every industry and every company size, and it’s the most mature DevOps teams with the most at stake who’ve felt the most pain. \nHistorically, if you wanted DevOps to work, you had to be prepared to pay for it. Just managing the backbone of DevOps – the toolchain -– has been a grind.
