In fact, you can omit stages completely and have a \"stageless\" pipeline that executes entirely based on the needs dependencies.\nUnderstanding stages\nIn GitLab CI/CD, you use stages to group jobs based on the development workflow and control the order of execution for CI/CD jobs.\nPipelines execute each stage in order, where all jobs in a single stage run in parallel.

          "description": "DevOps has evolved since its infancy, over a decade ago. Swiss developmental psychologist Jean Piaget believed human cognitive development has four stages (sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational). Through each of these stages, the human mind obtains new knowledge while building and modifying memories to inform one's understanding of the world around them.\nIn the same way that people go through stages as they grow, markets and industries also go through stages of development. Over the years, DevOps has grown into a mature, business-critical practice.\nAs the DevOps industry expanded, so did the number and complexity of tool-project integrations within an organization. This was the result of three developments in DevOps:\nCompanies moved from monolithic arch…",

Yes, you read that correctly, probably not the NFS (Network File System) you were expecting.\nAn appetite for change\nFor context, the NFS series originally set out to redefine a saturated, yet unsophisticated, racing video game market. Motivated by an appetite for change, the NFS user experience reflected the human connection to real cars and how they behaved, which was a big challenge for developers in the 1990s. Nearly 30 years ago, \"The Need for Speed\" forever changed the landscape of racing games, selling 150 million copies since its debut.\n\nThe original Need For Speed vide…",
