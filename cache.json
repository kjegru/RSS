GitLab Runner is the execution engine that \"does the work,\" enabling you, as a developer, to run fast, scalable CI/CD pipelines on your on-premises infrastructure or the cloud. Historically, Apple developers on GitLab SaaS had to set up runners on their own macOS systems to execute CI/CD workflows, introducing additional cost and operational overhead. As organizations and teams develop more apps for the Apple ecosystem, the need to create and deploy quickly becomes more important.\nIntroducing GitLab Build Cloud for macOS Beta\nToday, you can say goodbye to that Mac mini under your desk!

Today these supply chains are under attack, with malicious actors jeopardizing the sensitive data of millions of users through attacks on the public and private sectors.\nAfter public and federal entities were targeted in some high-profile supply chain attacks, the United States government released an executive order with plans to improve the security posture of the nation when it comes to software supply chains.

It's a major brick in the DevOps \"Automation\" pillar and every company involved in IT has to implement CI/CD or they're already quite far behind the curve.\nBut implementing CI/CD can be challenging especially for growing or large companies. Some of those challenges include:\nDevOps expertise and technical skills\nDevSecOps\nStandardization\nThree key hurdles that come with implementing CI/CD\nThis blog post unpackes these challenges and explains how Orange overcame them using GitLab.\nDevOps and technical skills\nNo matter which CI/CD tool you're using, it requires some amount of expertise to implement it right.\nDevOps expertise is important because your team needs some experience with Git workflows, deployment, environments, secrets m…",

          "description": "The importance of container image security\nThanks to containers, what it means to \"ship software\" has changed dramatically. Engineering teams have shifted to produce container images and use these container images to deploy their software. Because of this change teams are now shipping significantly more software alongside their app – whether they realize it or not.\nBesides packaging an application, container images also include hundreds of binaries and libraries. These binaries and libraries are included in the container image produced by the team because the process of creating a container image requires teams to select a base image. A base image is a preexisting container image on which to \"base\" their own container image. In doing so, all software contained in the base image is inherite…",
