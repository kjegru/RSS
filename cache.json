For many organizations in the public sector and regulated industries that only use Red Hat OpenShift, the Operator unlocks the ability to use GitLab, the DevOps Platform, allowing them to move out of the DIY DevOps stage and embrace modern DevOps practices with greater speed, efficiency, and improved security.\n \n\n\n\nWhy did we build the GitLab Operator?\nWe believe user expectations are at an all-time high.

Starting on 2021-10-12 we will deploy the OneTrust Cookie Management Tool to manage cookies across all gitlab.com sites. This change will provide users with a central location to opt in or out of cookies that are not strictly necessary for our site and its subdomains, including docs.gitlab.com, about.gitlab.com and customers.gitlab.com.\nWe also plan to add  a cookie to our trial signup flow and to our commerce flows located inside the gitlab.com application to enable us to understand how visitors are engaging with these pages and to help analyze and and improve these flows and resolve any technical issues.  This cookie will not be used for any tracking of how you use the functionality of our SaaS or self-managed products, and users can opt in or out of this cookie through our cookie management tool.\nWhat won’t change\nWe will not be adding additional metrics or mechanisms to collect analytics data from our core product (including all GitLab features and categories). We will continue to honor the Do Not Track (DNT) mechanism in web browsers for both GitLab.com and GitLab Self-Managed users.\nTimeline and implementation\nWe plan to roll  out the new cookie management tool on 2021-10-12. This will replace our current cookie tool and will require users to review a new cookie notice and manage the settings of cookies on their next visit. Those settings will be retained per-device and per browser and can be modified after the original selection.",

          "description": "Threat modeling is more common in people’s everyday lives than they might think.  Each of us performs some level of threat modeling every time we’re in a situation where we’re evaluating threats. An everyday example I really like: crossing the street. Before we cross the street we look both ways, we evaluate the speed of each oncoming vehicle and verify the driver has seen us. Finally, if the lights are green, we cross the street.

Today, it’s an entirely different world: DevOps is increasingly mainstream and there's a DevOps platform revolution.\nWe didn’t have a crystal ball back then, but we did try to create a product, a culture and a company that reflected what we thought mattered most. Here’s a look back at 10 key decisions we made that still have impact:\nWork in parallel: When we started, it was clear the waterfall method of software development - where one stage waited on another stage and nothing happened independently - slowed everything. We decided right from the beginning that a “work in parallel” philosophy would be fundamental to our culture and our behaviors.

          "description": "GitLab has been working on a process to intentionally limit our own ability to identify individual users from Service Usage Data in order to protect user privacy even better. Earlier this year, we solicited input on plans to de-identify GitLab’s Service Usage Data. We are now ready to move forward with a new system to de-identify SaaS usage data before it enters GitLab’s internal analytics environment.\nWhat isn’t changing?\nThe service usage data policy for SaaS and Self-Managed remains unchanged.\nWhat is changing?\nWith user privacy in mind, we are building a pseudonymization process to run against our SaaS service usage data.\nWe have determined that we do not need fully identifiable information anymore for our analytics environment, and as such we are pursuing this approach that will result in better privacy for GitLab users.\nWe’ll create a one-way hash or transform directly identifiable data. This means that the data will be hashed at the collection layer before it is sent to our analytics environment.\nYou can read more details about our pseudonymization solution here. Once our pseudonymization solution is in place, we will update data we collect to ensure it follows the  solution. You can read more about what data we collect and its de-identification state here.\nTimeline and implementation\nWe’re planning to roll out these changes in October 2021. Keep an eye on our Product Intelligence roadmap to monitor our progress. Once complete, we’ll update this blog post with the final status.\nMore information\nPlease find more information about our privacy policy. Further details on how service usage data is used for product improvement can be found on our Product Direction page.
