The agentk communicates to the GitLab Kubernetes Agent Server (kas) to perform GitOps operations.\nIn many examples, we see the agent being deployed with global-level permissions on your cluster. There are use cases where we want to reduce the scope of what agentk has access to. In this guide I will provide information on deploying agentk on your cluster, limiting what namespaces it can access, as well as using it to deploy your applications.\nPrefer a video?

This is a particular challenge for siloed mainframe development teams that typically work within their own development tools – and those tools are are not the same ones used by their distributed developer counterparts. These disparate toolsets are not integrated between build, package, test, and deploy steps. GitLab aims to provide a unified enterprise-wide DevOps platform with enhanced support for IBM z/OS® applications.

Read the first post.\nCode review can be one of the most deceivingly difficult things in delivering software faster. Given the high stakes involved, we've made some key additions to our DevOps Platform that focus on making the code review process as seamless and effective as possible. We believe the number one way to make code reviews effective is to provide context. Too often we think of code reviews as only \"reading\" and commenting on others' code - but what a good code reviewer does is understand the entire context of the proposed change.

Just managing the backbone of DevOps – the toolchain -– has been a grind.
