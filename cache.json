          "description": "How DevOps and NFS changed the game\nWhat if I told you that one of the best-selling racing video game franchises of all time, the \"Need For Speed\" (NFS), and DevOps have more in common with each other than you think? Yes, you read that correctly, probably not the NFS (Network File System) you were expecting.\nAn appetite for change\nFor context, the NFS series originally set out to redefine a saturated, yet unsophisticated, racing video game market. Motivated by an appetite for change, the NFS user experience reflected the human connection to real cars and how they behaved, which was a big challenge for developers in the 1990s. Nearly 30 years ago, \"The Need for Speed\" forever changed the landscape of racing games, selling 150 million copies since its debut.\n\nThe original Need For Speed vide…",

Because of this change teams are now shipping significantly more software alongside their app – whether they realize it or not.\nBesides packaging an application, container images also include hundreds of binaries and libraries. These binaries and libraries are included in the container image produced by the team because the process of creating a container image requires teams to select a base image.
