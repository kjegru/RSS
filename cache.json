A lack of automated software testing, combined with too many manual tests conducted too late in the process, was a story told time after time, and it certainly was one without any kind of happy ending.\nDespite the undeniable progress DevOps has brought to software development, integrating automated software testing into the lifecycle has remained an elusive goal for many teams. Here’s a look at why testing is such a difficult step to get right, and how an integrated DevOps Platform can bring much-needed structure to the process.\nThe state of automated software testing\nAccording to our 2021 Survey, it’s safe to say respondents are frustrated with software test…",

When done poorly, localization or l10n, as it's commonly known, can slow down your development process, introduce bugs, and make it cumbersome to launch updates. When done right, teams can smooth out the process and continuously localize their app. We unpack how Weet conquered its localization problems using GitLab and Lokalise.\nWhat is Weet?\nWeet is an asynchronous video communication tool designed to reduce the need for meetings.
