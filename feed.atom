        <id>https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/06/28/package-key-extension/</id>
        <link href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/06/28/package-key-extension/"/>
        <updated>2021-06-28T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GitLab uses a GPG key to sign all Omnibus packages created within the CI pipelines to insure that the packages have not been tampered with. This key is seperate from the repository metadata signing key used by package managers and the GPG signing key for the GitLab Runner. The Omnibus package signing key is set to expire on July 1, 2021 and will be extended to expire on July 1, 2022 instead.
Why are we extending the deadline?
The Omnibus package signing key's expiration is extended each year to comply with GitLab security policies and to limit the exposure should the key become compromised. The key's expiration is extended instead of rotating to a new key to be less disruptive for users that do verify package integrity checks prior to installing the package.
What do I need to do?
The only action that needs to be taken is to update your copy of the package signing key if you validate the signatures on the Omnibus packages that GitLab distributes.
The package signing key is not the key that signs the repository metadata used by the OS package managers like apt or yum. Unless you are specifically verifying the package signatures or have configured your package manager to verify the package signatures, there is no action needed on your part to continue installing Omnibus packages.
More information concerning verification of the package signatures
is available in the Omnibus documentation. If you just need to refresh a copy
of the public key, then you can find it on any of the GPG keyservers by
searching for support@gitlab.com or using the key ID of
DBEF 8977 4DDB 9EB3 7D9F  C3A0 3CFC F9BA F27E AB47. Alternatively you could
download it directly from packages.gitlab.com using the URL:
https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/nightly-builds/gpgkey/gitlab-nightly-builds-3D645A26AB9FBD22.pub.gpg


What do I do if I still have problems?
Please open an issue in the omnibus-gitlab issue tracker.]]></summary>

Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube's policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)

This post is a 3-part series, in which we delve deeper into these options. In this first part, we cover the pull-based or agent-based approach.
About a pull-based or agent-based approach
In this approach, an agent is installed in your infrastructure components to pull changes whenever there is a drift from the desired configuration, which resides in GitLab. Although the infrastructure components could be anything from a physical server or router to a VM or a database, we will focus on a Kubernetes cluster in this section.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently discovered a Usage Ping  configuration bug for self-managed instances and have since published a patch release to fix the bug. The issue affects the ability to disable Usage Ping for self-managed GitLab via text configuration files, resulting in the collection and transmission of Usage Ping events from the instance. This bug affects any instance running GitLab version 9.3 to version 13.12.3, and was patched in 13.12.4.
What does this mean for existing users?
This issue does not affect customers who have disabled Usage Ping via the user interface or any users of our SaaS product.
You can check your instance configuration settings to see if this issue may have affected you. We’ve published more detailed instructions here.
What should I do?
Since we do not collect any configuration data from your instance, we have no way to detect if you unintentionally shared data with GitLab. Out of an abundance of caution, we ask that you fill out this form if you suspect that Usage Ping data was shared after taking steps to opt-out in your GitLab configuration file. We will purge data from our systems and follow up with confirmation.
Please share your questions and feedback with us on the community forum.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In today's competitive digital era, it is imperative for organizations to undergo a digital transformation to effectively compete. For many, achieving a digital transformation means transitioning toward a DevOps model.
DevOps has been around for many years, and the development side of the house has benefitted from the core practices of DevOps. However, the infrastructure side of the house has been lagging behind, particularly when it comes to speed. With infrastructure as code (IaC) and GitOps, infrastructure teams have been able to apply the same disciplines and quality gates that are used to manage application code to the infrastructure - to deliver products faster, with more predictability and at scale.
Security slowing down delivery
While the GitOps concept promises faster and more fre…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Development teams are building, testing, and shipping code faster than ever before. Today, we know that security has a role to play at the early stages of the DevOps workflow, but these security controls are mostly centered around finding and fixing bugs and vulnerabilities during development.
In this tutorial, we will explore the importance of protecting client-side application code at runtime and guide you through implementing it in your GitLab instance using the integration with Jscrambler.
The importance of runtime code protection
With web and mobile applications dealing with increasingly sensitive data, addressing the application's attack surface requires considering additional threats that are not directly linked to vulnerabilities.
This concern has been widely covered in NIST, ISO 2…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GitLab's complete DevOps platform comes with built-in continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) via GitLab CI/CD. GitLab CI/CD is a great solution to increase developer productivity and motivation to write higher-quality code without sacrificing speed. It runs a series of tests every time a commit is pushed, providing immediate visibility into the results of changes in the codebase. While it is not a hassle to set up a CI using Linux-based machines, iOS and macOS developers may find it is more complicated to have access to a Mac that is connected and available 24 hours a day.
GitLab Runners, provided on GitLab.com, are the engine that executes CI workflows. Due to various requirements, some users may opt to self-host runners on public cloud VMs. This is super easy if the bui…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today we are releasing version 13.12.3 for GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.
This version resolves a number of regressions and bugs in
last month's 13.12 release and
prior versions.
GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition
Fix maven & gradle examples in the docs, enabling line-by-line display of test coverage in merge requests out-of-the-box (for java &
kotlin)
Fix issue with frames not loading in Safari
Improve SSH key expiration warning emails
Add an option to expose description_html in Release API [RUN ALL RSPEC] [RUN AS-IF-FOSS]
Fix CSP issues related to captchas
Set CSP back to disabled by default
Fix referrer option passed to Akismet client
Fix passing environment variables for migrations
Important notes on upgrading
This version does not include any new migrations, and for multi-node deployments, should not require any downtime.
Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-reconfigure file,
which is only used for updates.
Updating
To update, check out our update page.
GitLab subscriptions
Access to GitLab Premium and Ultimate features is granted by a paid subscription.
Alternatively, sign up for GitLab.com
to use GitLab's own infrastructure.]]></summary>

Our team is distributed globally, and we have engineers working in India, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. I am located in the U.S. in Pacific Standard Time (PST).

Global distribution as an advantage
Many managers view global team distribution as a constraint (because synchronous communication becomes more difficult), but it is possible to embrace the constraint and turn it into an advantage.

integration on GitLab.com to allow as many GitLab.com users as possible access

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Debate always swirls over what term is best: DevSecOps, SecDevOps, or even to drop “sec” altogether since it should be ubiquitous. At GitLab, we have a strong point of view on this: DevSecOps places security in the middle of the DevOps effort, which is where it rightly belongs. While transparent and a natural part of the process, it should be top of mind and not buried. Security needs to be everyone’s responsibility. With automation of processes and policies, it can be much easier to arm developers and security pros alike with the information they need in order to meet this responsibility.
Our DevSecOps platform is the end-to-end secure software solution that helps you plan, create, deploy, secure, and manage your modern software and the infrastructure upon which it relies. GitLab provides…]]></summary>
