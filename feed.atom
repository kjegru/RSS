        <updated>2021-07-05T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today we are releasing version 13.12.7 for GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.
This version resolves a number of regressions and bugs in
this month's 13.12 release and
prior versions.
GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition
Available in GitLab Free, Premium, and Ultimate:
Fix pages deployment storage migration
Reintroduce recursive_approach_for_all_projects default-enabled
Exempt unicorn['svlogd_prefix'] from deprecation check
Gitaly: fixes to issues with strong consistency/transactional voting
Geo - Fix state value in the lfs_object_registry table
Important notes on upgrading
This version does not include any new migrations, and for multi-node deployments, should not require any downtime.
Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-reconfigure file,
which is only used for updates.
Updating
To update, check out our update page.
GitLab subscriptions
Access to GitLab Premium and Ultimate features is granted by a paid subscription.
Alternatively, sign up for GitLab.com
to use GitLab's own infrastructure.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/06/28/package-key-extension/"/>
        <updated>2021-06-28T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GitLab uses a GPG key to sign all Omnibus packages created within the CI pipelines to insure that the packages have not been tampered with. This key is seperate from the repository metadata signing key used by package managers and the GPG signing key for the GitLab Runner. The Omnibus package signing key is set to expire on July 1, 2021 and will be extended to expire on July 1, 2022 instead.
Why are we extending the deadline?
The Omnibus package signing key's expiration is extended each year to comply with GitLab security policies and to limit the exposure should the key become compromised. The key's expiration is extended instead of rotating to a new key to be less disruptive for users that do verify package integrity checks prior to installing the package.
What do I need to do?
The only action that needs to be taken is to update your copy of the package signing key if you validate the signatures on the Omnibus packages that GitLab distributes.
The package signing key is not the key that signs the repository metadata used by the OS package managers like apt or yum. Unless you are specifically verifying the package signatures or have configured your package manager to verify the package signatures, there is no action needed on your part to continue installing Omnibus packages.
More information concerning verification of the package signatures
is available in the Omnibus documentation. If you just need to refresh a copy
of the public key, then you can find it on any of the GPG keyservers by
searching for support@gitlab.com or using the key ID of
DBEF 8977 4DDB 9EB3 7D9F  C3A0 3CFC F9BA F27E AB47. Alternatively you could
download it directly from packages.gitlab.com using the URL:
https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/nightly-builds/gpgkey/gitlab-nightly-builds-3D645A26AB9FBD22.pub.gpg


What do I do if I still have problems?

About a pull-based or agent-based approach
In this approach, an agent is installed in your infrastructure components to pull changes whenever there is a drift from the desired configuration, which resides in GitLab. Although the infrastructure components could be anything from a physical server or router to a VM or a database, we will focus on a Kubernetes cluster in this section.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently discovered a Usage Ping  configuration bug for self-managed instances and have since published a patch release to fix the bug. The issue affects the ability to disable Usage Ping for self-managed GitLab via text configuration files, resulting in the collection and transmission of Usage Ping events from the instance. This bug affects any instance running GitLab version 9.3 to version 13.12.3, and was patched in 13.12.4.
What does this mean for existing users?
This issue does not affect customers who have disabled Usage Ping via the user interface or any users of our SaaS product.
You can check your instance configuration settings to see if this issue may have affected you. We’ve published more detailed instructions here.
What should I do?
Since we do not collect any configuration data from your instance, we have no way to detect if you unintentionally shared data with GitLab. Out of an abundance of caution, we ask that you fill out this form if you suspect that Usage Ping data was shared after taking steps to opt-out in your GitLab configuration file. We will purge data from our systems and follow up with confirmation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year I wrote about how the Quality Engineering Enablement team was building up the performance testing of GitLab with the GitLab Performance Tool (GPT). Last year, the biggest challenge with performance testing wasn't so much the testing but rather setting up the right large scale GitLab environments to test against.
Like any server application, deploying at scale is challenging. That's why we built another toolkit that automates the deployment of GitLab at scale: The GitLab Environment Toolkit (GET).

Internally called the "Performance Environment Builder" (PEB), GET grew alongside GPT as we continued to expand our performance testing efforts. Over time we built a toolkit that was quite capable in its own right of deploying GitLab at scale, which is wh…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today we are releasing version 13.12.4 for GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.
This version resolves a number of regressions and bugs in
this month's 13.12 release and
prior versions.
GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition
Available in GitLab Free, Premium, and Ultimate:
Fix double render in project's git URL redirect
Fix MR diff compare with previous version
Add alias method usage_ping_enabled?
Do not show Praefect deprecation if Praefect is disabled
Update Mattermost to 5.34.4
Important notes on upgrading
This version does not include any new migrations, and for multi-node deployments, should not require any downtime.
Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-reconfigure file,
which is only used for updates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GitLab is best known as a complete open source DevOps platform, delivered as a single application, but it also offers powerful project management and collaboration capabilities. In fact, every GitLab team uses GitLab to develop, track and collaborate on projects, processes, and programs.
But, what about… other uses? Say … hacking, for instance. 🤷‍♀️
Can GitLab help a hacker fine-tune their craft? Through our Ask a Hacker AMA series we discovered that there are some bug bounty hunters who use GitLab to streamline their research process. And, like so many cool and awesome things, we learned on Twitter about another contributor using GitLab for bug bounty hunting.  So, we followed up to learn more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In today's competitive digital era, it is imperative for organizations to undergo a digital transformation to effectively compete. For many, achieving a digital transformation means transitioning toward a DevOps model.
DevOps has been around for many years, and the development side of the house has benefitted from the core practices of DevOps. However, the infrastructure side of the house has been lagging behind, particularly when it comes to speed. With infrastructure as code (IaC) and GitOps, infrastructure teams have been able to apply the same disciplines and quality gates that are used to manage application code to the infrastructure - to deliver products faster, with more predictability and at scale.
Security slowing down delivery

Today, we know that security has a role to play at the early stages of the DevOps workflow, but these security controls are mostly centered around finding and fixing bugs and vulnerabilities during development.
In this tutorial, we will explore the importance of protecting client-side application code at runtime and guide you through implementing it in your GitLab instance using the integration with Jscrambler.
The importance of runtime code protection
With web and mobile applications dealing with increasingly sensitive data, addressing the application's attack surface requires considering additional threats that are not directly linked to vulnerabilities.

GitLab CI/CD is a great solution to increase developer productivity and motivation to write higher-quality code without sacrificing speed. It runs a series of tests every time a commit is pushed, providing immediate visibility into the results of changes in the codebase. While it is not a hassle to set up a CI using Linux-based machines, iOS and macOS developers may find it is more complicated to have access to a Mac that is connected and available 24 hours a day.
GitLab Runners, provided on GitLab.com, are the engine that executes CI workflows. Due to various requirements, some users may opt to self-host runners on public cloud VMs. This is super easy if the bui…]]></summary>
