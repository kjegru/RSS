This post is a 3-part series, in which we delve deeper into these options. In this first part, we cover the pull-based or agent-based approach.
About a pull-based or agent-based approach
In this approach, an agent is installed in your infrastructure components to pull changes whenever there is a drift from the desired configuration, which resides in GitLab. Although the infrastructure components could be anything from a physical server or router to a VM or a database, we will focus on a Kubernetes cluster in this section.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently discovered a Usage Ping  configuration bug for self-managed instances and have since published a patch release to fix the bug. The issue affects the ability to disable Usage Ping for self-managed GitLab via text configuration files, resulting in the collection and transmission of Usage Ping events from the instance. This bug affects any instance running GitLab version 9.3 to version 13.12.3, and was patched in 13.12.4.
What does this mean for existing users?
This issue does not affect customers who have disabled Usage Ping via the user interface or any users of our SaaS product.
You can check your instance configuration settings to see if this issue may have affected you. We’ve published more detailed instructions here.
What should I do?
Since we do not collect any configuration data from your instance, we have no way to detect if you unintentionally shared data with GitLab. Out of an abundance of caution, we ask that you fill out this form if you suspect that Usage Ping data was shared after taking steps to opt-out in your GitLab configuration file. We will purge data from our systems and follow up with confirmation.
Please share your questions and feedback with us on the community forum.]]></summary>

Can GitLab help a hacker fine-tune their craft? Through our Ask a Hacker AMA series we discovered that there are some bug bounty hunters who use GitLab to streamline their research process.

DevOps has been around for many years, and the development side of the house has benefitted from the core practices of DevOps. However, the infrastructure side of the house has been lagging behind, particularly when it comes to speed. With infrastructure as code (IaC) and GitOps, infrastructure teams have been able to apply the same disciplines and quality gates that are used to manage application code to the infrastructure - to deliver products faster, with more predictability and at scale.

GitLab CI/CD is a great solution to increase developer productivity and motivation to write higher-quality code without sacrificing speed. It runs a series of tests every time a commit is pushed, providing immediate visibility into the results of changes in the codebase. While it is not a hassle to set up a CI using Linux-based machines, iOS and macOS developers may find it is more complicated to have access to a Mac that is connected and available 24 hours a day.
GitLab Runners, provided on GitLab.com, are the engine that executes CI workflows. Due to various requirements, some users may opt to self-host runners on public cloud VMs. This is super easy if the bui…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today we are releasing version 13.12.3 for GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.
This version resolves a number of regressions and bugs in
last month's 13.12 release and
prior versions.
GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition
Fix maven & gradle examples in the docs, enabling line-by-line display of test coverage in merge requests out-of-the-box (for java &
kotlin)
Fix issue with frames not loading in Safari
Improve SSH key expiration warning emails
Add an option to expose description_html in Release API [RUN ALL RSPEC] [RUN AS-IF-FOSS]
Fix CSP issues related to captchas
Set CSP back to disabled by default
Fix referrer option passed to Akismet client
Fix passing environment variables for migrations
Important notes on upgrading
This version does not include any new migrations, and for multi-node deployments, should not require any downtime.
Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-reconfigure file,
which is only used for updates.
Updating
To update, check out our update page.
GitLab subscriptions
Access to GitLab Premium and Ultimate features is granted by a paid subscription.

to use GitLab's own infrastructure.]]></summary>

Our team is distributed globally, and we have engineers working in India, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. I am located in the U.S. in Pacific Standard Time (PST). In coordination with other globally distributed engineering teams, we recently responded to an abuse issue which was causing disruptions for legitimate GitLab.com users, and required a rapid response.
Global distribution as an advantage
Many managers view global team distribution as a constraint (because synchronous communication becomes more difficult), but it is possible to embrace the constraint and turn it into an advantage. When teams are globally distributed it is possible for work to continue around-the-clock, uninterru…]]></summary>

GitLab 14.0 is coming to GitLab.com. Along with the exciting new features, it also includes planned deprecations because it is the major version release for 2021. We try to minimize breaking changes, but some changes are needed to improve workflows, performance, scalability, and more.

integration on GitLab.com to allow as many GitLab.com users as possible access
to the Advanced Global Search
features. Last year, after enabling Advanced Search for all licensed customers on
GitLab.com we were thinking how to simplify the rollout of some Advanced Search
features that require changing the data in Elasticsearch.

Elasticsearch for GitLab.com, you can read all about it.
The data migration process problem
Sometimes we need to change mappings of an index or backfill a field, and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Debate always swirls over what term is best: DevSecOps, SecDevOps, or even to drop “sec” altogether since it should be ubiquitous. At GitLab, we have a strong point of view on this: DevSecOps places security in the middle of the DevOps effort, which is where it rightly belongs. While transparent and a natural part of the process, it should be top of mind and not buried. Security needs to be everyone’s responsibility. With automation of processes and policies, it can be much easier to arm developers and security pros alike with the information they need in order to meet this responsibility.
Our DevSecOps platform is the end-to-end secure software solution that helps you plan, create, deploy, secure, and manage your modern software and the infrastructure upon which it relies. GitLab provides…]]></summary>

GitLab releases patches for vulnerabilities in dedicated security releases. There are two types of security releases: a monthly, scheduled security release, released a week after the feature release (which deploys on the 22nd of each month), and ad-hoc security releases for critical vulnerabilities. For more information, you can visit our security FAQ. You can see all of our regular and security release blog posts here.

Security teams know supply chain attacks aren't new – they've been around for decades. But, what may have once been considered mainly nation-state threats have now increased in prevalence and sophistication. Malicious actors are now setting their sights on widely used technology like software applications and code repositories to compromise unsuspecting suppliers.
So how do we protect our customers and product?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is "experimental" due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata]]></summary>
