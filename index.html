                    <span>UBS, the largest truly global wealth manager, uses GitLab to power DevCloud, a single DevOps Platform that allows for a cloud-based, service-oriented, software development lifecycle.
&quot;GitLab is a fundamental part of DevCloud,&quot; said Rick Carey, Group Chief Technology Officer at UBS. &quot;We wouldn&#x27;t be able to have that seamless experience without GitLab. It allowed us to pull ahead of many of our competitors, and break down the barriers between coding, testing, and deployment.&quot;
During GitLab Virtual Commit 2021, Rick and Eric Johnson, Chief Technology Officer at GitLab, talked about how building DevCloud on GitLab&#x27;s DevOps Platform allowed UBS to increase their development velocity, lower their infrastructure costs, and increase collaboration between engineers and non-engineering teams worldwi…</span>

                    <span>DevOps has evolved since its infancy, over a decade ago. Swiss developmental psychologist Jean Piaget believed human cognitive development has four stages (sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational). Through each of these stages, the human mind obtains new knowledge while building and modifying memories to inform one&#x27;s understanding of the world around them.
In the same way that people go through stages as they grow, markets and industries also go through stages of development. Over the years, DevOps has grown into a mature, business-critical practice.
As the DevOps industry expanded, so did the number and complexity of tool-project integrations within an organization. This was the result of three developments in DevOps:

For more information, you can visit our security FAQ. You can see all of our regular and security release blog posts here.

                    <span>How DevOps and NFS changed the game
What if I told you that one of the best-selling racing video game franchises of all time, the &quot;Need For Speed&quot; (NFS), and DevOps have more in common with each other than you think? Yes, you read that correctly, probably not the NFS (Network File System) you were expecting.
An appetite for change
For context, the NFS series originally set out to redefine a saturated, yet unsophisticated, racing video game market. Motivated by an appetite for change, the NFS user experience reflected the human connection to real cars and how they behaved, which was a big challenge for developers in the 1990s. Nearly 30 years ago, &quot;The Need for Speed&quot; forever changed the landscape of racing games, selling 150 million copies since its debut.

                    <span>CI/CD is a foundational piece to modern software development. It&#x27;s a major brick in the DevOps &quot;Automation&quot; pillar and every company involved in IT has to implement CI/CD or they&#x27;re already quite far behind the curve.
But implementing CI/CD can be challenging especially for growing or large companies. Some of those challenges include:
DevOps expertise and technical skills
DevSecOps
Standardization
Three key hurdles that come with implementing CI/CD
This blog post unpackes these challenges and explains how Orange overcame them using GitLab.
DevOps and technical skills
No matter which CI/CD tool you&#x27;re using, it requires some amount of expertise to implement it right.

                    <span>The importance of container image security
Thanks to containers, what it means to &quot;ship software&quot; has changed dramatically. Engineering teams have shifted to produce container images and use these container images to deploy their software. Because of this change teams are now shipping significantly more software alongside their app – whether they realize it or not.
Besides packaging an application, container images also include hundreds of binaries and libraries. These binaries and libraries are included in the container image produced by the team because the process of creating a container image requires teams to select a base image. A base image is a preexisting container image on which to &quot;base&quot; their own container image. In doing so, all software contained in the base image is inherite…</span>

This version resolves a number of regressions and bugs in
this month&#x27;s 14.1 release and
prior versions.
GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition
Available in GitLab Free, Premium, and Ultimate:

Important notes on upgrading
This version does not include any new migrations, and for multi-node deployments, should not require any downtime.
Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-reconfigure file,
which is only used for updates.

                    <span>Cloud native application architectures use containerization, microservices, and Kubernetes to run reliably at cloud-scale. With a built-in container registry and Kubernetes integration, GitLab is the best way to develop and deploy cloud native applications. GitLab version 14.1 also includes a Helm registry, which allows users to publish, install, and share Helm charts and packages from within our single application for the entire DevOps lifecycle.
What is Helm?
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. A Chart is a Helm package that contains the resource definitions required to run an application inside a Kubernetes cluster. Helm allows you to manage complex applications by storing the application definition in a chart that can be versioned, shared, and collaborated on.

                    <span>In part one of our GitOps series, we described how to use a pull-based (or agent-based) approach. In this second blog post, we&#x27;ll dig deep into how to use a push-based approach. The agentless approach may be preferable for situations with non-Kubernetes infrastructure components or when you don&#x27;t want to install, run, and maintain agents in each infrastructure component for GitOps. In this post, we will discuss how the scripting capabilities of GitLab can be used in GitOps workflows, and how to use predefined GitLab variables to shape infrastructure components.

                    <span>Modern programming ecosystems make code reuse exceptionally easy. No matter the
programming task at hand, chances are there is a package in a public registry
such as rubygems.org or npmjs.com that implements that task.
While the reuse of publicly available packages reduces the time necessary to write an app, this reuse
brings its own set of challenges. Apps quickly depend on hundreds of packages,
and programmers often simply just trust that these packages don&#x27;t contain malicious code.
In an ideal world, all depended-upon code is thoroughly vetted before being included in a program – however, this is often unfeasible in practice due to the sheer amount of dependency code that needs to be reviewed and the lack of existing tools to help with vetting dependency code.

                    <span>DevOps makes teams and work more efficient, more consistent, and more productive – but how much more?
On its surface, the answer is simple. We need to measure workflow from idea to delivery, identify and remove blockers, and benchmark improvements in a manner that is consistent and replicable. The challenge is the way we&#x27;ve typically built the systems that hold the data we&#x27;re trying to understand.
Enhanced visibility tools are essential to measuring and optimizing modern DevOps processes, and mapping the work output to ensure the business outcomes that matter are achieved.
