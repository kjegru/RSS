                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/06/28/package-key-extension/">
                  <div class="article-summary-box-inner">
                    <span class="article-reading-time">(5 min)</span>
                    <span>GitLab uses a GPG key to sign all Omnibus packages created within the CI pipelines to insure that the packages have not been tampered with. This key is seperate from the repository metadata signing key used by package managers and the GPG signing key for the GitLab Runner. The Omnibus package signing key is set to expire on July 1, 2021 and will be extended to expire on July 1, 2022 instead.
Why are we extending the deadline?
The Omnibus package signing key&#x27;s expiration is extended each year to comply with GitLab security policies and to limit the exposure should the key become compromised. The key&#x27;s expiration is extended instead of rotating to a new key to be less disruptive for users that do verify package integrity checks prior to installing the package.
What do I need to do?
The only action that needs to be taken is to update your copy of the package signing key if you validate the signatures on the Omnibus packages that GitLab distributes.
The package signing key is not the key that signs the repository metadata used by the OS package managers like apt or yum. Unless you are specifically verifying the package signatures or have configured your package manager to verify the package signatures, there is no action needed on your part to continue installing Omnibus packages.
More information concerning verification of the package signatures
is available in the Omnibus documentation. If you just need to refresh a copy
of the public key, then you can find it on any of the GPG keyservers by
searching for support@gitlab.com or using the key ID of
DBEF 8977 4DDB 9EB3 7D9F  C3A0 3CFC F9BA F27E AB47. Alternatively you could
download it directly from packages.gitlab.com using the URL:
https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/nightly-builds/gpgkey/gitlab-nightly-builds-3D645A26AB9FBD22.pub.gpg


What do I do if I still have problems?
Please open an issue in the omnibus-gitlab issue tracker.</span>

                    <span>Today we are releasing version 14.0.1 for GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.
This version resolves a number of regressions and bugs in
this month&#x27;s 14.0 release and
prior versions.
GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition
Available in GitLab Free, Premium, and Ultimate:
Update Geo UI screenshots in docs page
Update admin docs with new admin area access info
Add Helm-2to3.gitlab-ci.yml to Auto DevOps
Update docs for new Members page location on GitLab navigation

Important notes on upgrading
This version does not include any new migrations, and for multi-node deployments, should not require any downtime.
Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-reconfigure file,
which is only used for updates.
Updating
To update, check out our update page.

                    <span>In the previous post, titled 3 ways to approach GitOps, we discussed the many benefits and options that GitLab supports for fulfilling the GitOps requirements of customers, whose IT environments are composed of heterogeneous technologies and infrastructures. This post is a 3-part series, in which we delve deeper into these options. In this first part, we cover the pull-based or agent-based approach.
About a pull-based or agent-based approach
In this approach, an agent is installed in your infrastructure components to pull changes whenever there is a drift from the desired configuration, which resides in GitLab. Although the infrastructure components could be anything from a physical server or router to a VM or a database, we will focus on a Kubernetes cluster in this section.

                    <span>Added: support an experimental template for YouTube feed 📺 Demo | Source

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
Thank you @PiyushLosalka</span>

                    <span>The DevOps era began with a big idea – dissolve silos to deliver better software, faster. In the transition from classic software paradigms, DIY DevOps toolchains were built with parts that were never designed to work together. That DIY DevOps era left many trapped in new silos, without visibility, and mired in maintenance. Business outcomes suffered as the potential of DevOps was never fully realized.
The next iteration of DevOps
There is a better way to build software. GitLab 14 delivers modern DevOps with a complete DevOps platform, for a streamlined experience that unleashes the power of DevOps. Over the past year, GitLab has shipped advanced DevOps platform capabilities that enable any team to build and deliver software with velocity, trust, and visibility – no matter their size, indu…</span>

                    <span>When we think of everything released in the year since GitLab 13.0, we could not be more proud of our community and our team. This month, we celebrate our release of GitLab 14.0 by first taking a step back.
Together, we’ve made so much progress over the last year that we want to talk about everything it took to get to GitLab 14.
We use semantic versioning so a point release, like 14.0, represents everything new in this month. GitLab 14 is the culmination of the past year. Even more than that, GitLab 14 represents the future of GitLab, and the future of DevOps.
With GitLab 14, teams of all sizes are moving from maintaining DIY DevOps toolchains to adopting modern DevOps. GitLab 14 is a complete DevOps platform with security embedded in its DNA, visibility and insights enabled by its single …</span>

                    <span>We recently discovered a Usage Ping  configuration bug for self-managed instances and have since published a patch release to fix the bug. The issue affects the ability to disable Usage Ping for self-managed GitLab via text configuration files, resulting in the collection and transmission of Usage Ping events from the instance. This bug affects any instance running GitLab version 9.3 to version 13.12.3, and was patched in 13.12.4.
What does this mean for existing users?
This issue does not affect customers who have disabled Usage Ping via the user interface or any users of our SaaS product.
You can check your instance configuration settings to see if this issue may have affected you. We’ve published more detailed instructions here.
What should I do?
Since we do not collect any configuration data from your instance, we have no way to detect if you unintentionally shared data with GitLab. Out of an abundance of caution, we ask that you fill out this form if you suspect that Usage Ping data was shared after taking steps to opt-out in your GitLab configuration file. We will purge data from our systems and follow up with confirmation.
Please share your questions and feedback with us on the community forum.</span>

                    <span>CI/CD pipelines are the preeminent solution to mitigate potential risks while integrating code changes into the repository. CI/CD pipelines help isolate the impact of potential errors, making it easier to fix them. Top that with a tool that provides effective visibility into the running tasks and there you have a recipe for success.
Since the primary purpose of CI/CD pipelines is to speed up the development process and provide value to the end user faster, there&#x27;s always room to make the process more efficient. This blog post unpacks some strategies that can help you get the most out of your pipeline definition in GitLab CI.

                    <span>GitLab uses a GPG key to sign official GitLab Runner packages. We recently became aware of an instance where this key and other tokens used to distribute official GitLab Runner packages and binaries were not secured according to GitLab’s security policies.
We have not found any evidence of unauthorized modification of the packages or access to the services storing them. Our team has audited and investigated integrity hashes, bucket logs and versioning, and pipeline history and concluded that the unauthorized modification of any packages is exceedingly unlikely.
Out of an abundance of caution, the GPG key used for release signing and verification has been rotated along with all other tokens that were improperly secured.
If you use GitLab.com shared runners, this does not impact you.

                    <span>Last year I wrote about how the Quality Engineering Enablement team was building up the performance testing of GitLab with the GitLab Performance Tool (GPT). Last year, the biggest challenge with performance testing wasn&#x27;t so much the testing but rather setting up the right large scale GitLab environments to test against.
Like any server application, deploying at scale is challenging. That&#x27;s why we built another toolkit that automates the deployment of GitLab at scale: The GitLab Environment Toolkit (GET).

                    <span>GitLab is best known as a complete open source DevOps platform, delivered as a single application, but it also offers powerful project management and collaboration capabilities. In fact, every GitLab team uses GitLab to develop, track and collaborate on projects, processes, and programs.
But, what about… other uses? Say … hacking, for instance. 🤷‍♀️
Can GitLab help a hacker fine-tune their craft? Through our Ask a Hacker AMA series we discovered that there are some bug bounty hunters who use GitLab to streamline their research process. And, like so many cool and awesome things, we learned on Twitter about another contributor using GitLab for bug bounty hunting.  So, we followed up to learn more.

                    <span>In today&#x27;s competitive digital era, it is imperative for organizations to undergo a digital transformation to effectively compete. For many, achieving a digital transformation means transitioning toward a DevOps model.
DevOps has been around for many years, and the development side of the house has benefitted from the core practices of DevOps. However, the infrastructure side of the house has been lagging behind, particularly when it comes to speed. With infrastructure as code (IaC) and GitOps, infrastructure teams have been able to apply the same disciplines and quality gates that are used to manage application code to the infrastructure - to deliver products faster, with more predictability and at scale.

                    <span>GitLab&#x27;s complete DevOps platform comes with built-in continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) via GitLab CI/CD. GitLab CI/CD is a great solution to increase developer productivity and motivation to write higher-quality code without sacrificing speed. It runs a series of tests every time a commit is pushed, providing immediate visibility into the results of changes in the codebase. While it is not a hassle to set up a CI using Linux-based machines, iOS and macOS developers may find it is more complicated to have access to a Mac that is connected and available 24 hours a day.
GitLab Runners, provided on GitLab.com, are the engine that executes CI workflows. Due to various requirements, some users may opt to self-host runners on public cloud VMs. This is super easy if the bui…</span>

                    <span>Today we are releasing version 13.12.3 for GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.
This version resolves a number of regressions and bugs in
last month&#x27;s 13.12 release and
prior versions.
GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition
Fix maven &amp; gradle examples in the docs, enabling line-by-line display of test coverage in merge requests out-of-the-box (for java &amp;
kotlin)
Fix issue with frames not loading in Safari
Improve SSH key expiration warning emails
Add an option to expose description_html in Release API [RUN ALL RSPEC] [RUN AS-IF-FOSS]
Fix CSP issues related to captchas
Set CSP back to disabled by default
Fix referrer option passed to Akismet client
Fix passing environment variables for migrations
Important notes on upgrading
This version does not include any new migrations, and for multi-node deployments, should not require any downtime.
Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-reconfigure file,
which is only used for updates.
Updating
To update, check out our update page.
GitLab subscriptions
Access to GitLab Premium and Ultimate features is granted by a paid subscription.
Alternatively, sign up for GitLab.com
to use GitLab&#x27;s own infrastructure.</span>

                    <span>I am an Engineering Manager working on a distributed engineering team at GitLab. Our team is distributed globally, and we have engineers working in India, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. I am located in the U.S. in Pacific Standard Time (PST). In coordination with other globally distributed engineering teams, we recently responded to an abuse issue which was causing disruptions for legitimate GitLab.com users, and required a rapid response.
Global distribution as an advantage
Many managers view global team distribution as a constraint (because synchronous communication becomes more difficult), but it is possible to embrace the constraint and turn it into an advantage. When teams are globally distributed it is possible for work to continue around-the-clock, uninterru…</span>

                    <span>GitLab 14.0: Our annual major release
GitLab 14.0 is coming to GitLab.com. Along with the exciting new features, it also includes planned deprecations because it is the major version release for 2021. We try to minimize breaking changes, but some changes are needed to improve workflows, performance, scalability, and more.
These changes will go live on GitLab.com sometime between May 23 – June 22, through our daily deployments, leading up to the official release of 14.0 on June 22. Keep reading to learn more about these important changes.
GitLab 14.0 for self-managed users will also be released on June 22, read on for more information about deprecations and removals for self-managed instances.

                    <span>For some time now, GitLab has been working on enabling the Elasticsearch
integration on GitLab.com to allow as many GitLab.com users as possible access
to the Advanced Global Search
features. Last year, after enabling Advanced Search for all licensed customers on
GitLab.com we were thinking how to simplify the rollout of some Advanced Search
features that require changing the data in Elasticsearch.

Elasticsearch for GitLab.com, you can read all about it.
The data migration process problem
Sometimes we need to change mappings of an index or backfill a field, and
reindexing everything from scratch or using Zero downtime reindexing
might seem like an obvious solution. However, this is not a scalable option for

                    <span>Debate always swirls over what term is best: DevSecOps, SecDevOps, or even to drop “sec” altogether since it should be ubiquitous. At GitLab, we have a strong point of view on this: DevSecOps places security in the middle of the DevOps effort, which is where it rightly belongs. While transparent and a natural part of the process, it should be top of mind and not buried. Security needs to be everyone’s responsibility. With automation of processes and policies, it can be much easier to arm developers and security pros alike with the information they need in order to meet this responsibility.
Our DevSecOps platform is the end-to-end secure software solution that helps you plan, create, deploy, secure, and manage your modern software and the infrastructure upon which it relies. GitLab provides…</span>

These versions contain important security fixes, and we strongly recommend that all GitLab installations be upgraded to one of these versions immediately.
GitLab releases patches for vulnerabilities in dedicated security releases. There are two types of security releases: a monthly, scheduled security release, released a week after the feature release (which deploys on the 22nd of each month), and ad-hoc security releases for critical vulnerabilities. For more information, you can visit our security FAQ. You can see all of our regular and security release blog posts here.
