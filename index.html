                    <span>GitLab has been working on a process to intentionally limit our own ability to identify individual users from Service Usage Data in order to protect user privacy even better. Earlier this year, we solicited input on plans to de-identify GitLab’s Service Usage Data. We are now ready to move forward with a new system to de-identify SaaS usage data before it enters GitLab’s internal analytics environment.
What isn’t changing?
The service usage data policy for SaaS and Self-Managed remains unchanged.
What is changing?
With user privacy in mind, we are building a pseudonymization process to run against our SaaS service usage data.
We have determined that we do not need fully identifiable information anymore for our analytics environment, and as such we are pursuing this approach that will result in better privacy for GitLab users.
We’ll create a one-way hash or transform directly identifiable data. This means that the data will be hashed at the collection layer before it is sent to our analytics environment.
You can read more details about our pseudonymization solution here. Once our pseudonymization solution is in place, we will update data we collect to ensure it follows the  solution. You can read more about what data we collect and its de-identification state here.
Timeline and implementation
We’re planning to roll out these changes in October 2021. Keep an eye on our Product Intelligence roadmap to monitor our progress. Once complete, we’ll update this blog post with the final status.
More information
Please find more information about our privacy policy. Further details on how service usage data is used for product improvement can be found on our Product Direction page. Also see  GitLab’s analytics environment and SaaS Data Collection Catalog.

                    <span>This is the first in an occasional series of blog posts looking at DevOps salaries and careers.
Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic crisis that has disrupted lives and business across industries and around the world, demand for DevOps professionals remains strong and salaries continue to increase.
The IT industry, in general, fared better than many during the economic uncertainty of 2020 and 2021. With a strong IT infrastructure already in place and IT professionals accustomed to working remotely, increased demand and short supply for IT workers meant IT salaries held steady or rose in turbulent times, reported Randstad, a multinational human resources consulting firm. 
And DevOps professionals did even better than most in IT.

                    <span>If you have spent time reviewing GitLab Reference Architectures, you may have noticed the flexibility of the GitLab codebase; it&#x27;s possible to support a broad range of implementations from a single box for under one hundred users to horizontal hyper-scaled setups for 50,000 or more.
Scaling to massive sizes requires the services within GitLab to be broken out into dedicated compute and storage layers so they can each expand cost effectively based on high loading and an organization&#x27;s specific usage patterns.
Those who provision large scale systems on the cloud generally turn to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to ensure consistency and to allow easy setup of pre-production environments for the target system. Until recently, GitLab implementers have had to craft this code from scratch.

                    <span>The external status checks for merge requests capability was recently introduced in GitLab and it allows the integration of third-party systems and applications with GitLab merge requests.
What are &quot;external status checks for merge requests&quot;?
External status checks are API calls to systems or applications that sit outside GitLab. These API calls are invoked during merge requests, which display a widget with the status of each external check. With external status checks, you can integrate GitLab with third-party systems, e.g. Salesforce, PeopleSoft, Microsoft Dynamics, etc., that require manual approval for merge requests. This makes it easy to see that merge requests have met external requirements before being merged, adding an extra method to ensure compliance and audit requirements are m…</span>

                    <span>Today we are releasing version 14.3.2 GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.
This version resolves a number of regressions and bugs in
the 14.3 release and
prior versions.
GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition
Add OR REPLACE when creating function
Top 7 Highlight items for 14.3
Update GitLab Shell to v13.21.1

Important notes on upgrading
These versions do not include any new migrations, and for multi-node deployments, should not require any downtime.
Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-reconfigure file,
which is only used for updates.

                    <span>The GitLab user profile contains information about you and your GitLab activity. You can select what information to display.
We recently added a few new settings to make you user profile more personal:
User pronouns
User pronunciation guides
User local times
User pronouns
You can now set pronouns to your GitLab user profile. The pronoun appears:
Next to your user name in your public profile.
On the snapshot view of your user profile when someone hovers over your name on an issue or
merge request.
Besides being more inclusive, GitLab wants to help you use the correct pronouns when replying
to comments to respect people&#x27;s identity. You can:
Decide whether or not to add pronouns to your profile.
Self-identify and enter whatever pronouns you want, without having to select from a pre-defined list.
Read more about adding
pronouns to your profile.
User pronunciation
You can now add a pronunciation guide to your user profile. In distributed teams where team
members are from different countries, it can be difficult to determine how to say someone&#x27;s
name correctly. You can now help people know how to pronounce your name.
Read more about adding a
pronunciation guide to your profile.
User local time
Your local time is now displayed on your profile. Previously, you could set your time
zone but your local time was not visible throughout GitLab. This improvement helps
others know when you are likely to be available.
Read more about adding a
local time zone to your profile.
Additional settings for user profiles
In the upcoming milestone, we are planning to add your timezone to the snapshot view of the GitLab user profile.
In GitLab, everyone can contribute. If you would like to see even
more additions to user profiles, you can:
Open an issue with your request.
Upvote an existing issue. Read more in our Users direction page.
Even code it yourself!

                    <span>For three years in a row, our Global DevSecOps Survey found testing was the number one reason (by large margins) for release delays. A lack of automated software testing, combined with too many manual tests conducted too late in the process, was a story told time after time, and it certainly was one without any kind of happy ending.
Despite the undeniable progress DevOps has brought to software development, integrating automated software testing into the lifecycle has remained an elusive goal for many teams. Here’s a look at why testing is such a difficult step to get right, and how an integrated DevOps Platform can bring much-needed structure to the process.

                    <span>Since last June, we noticed the database on GitLab.com would
mysteriously stall for minutes, which would lead to users seeing 500
errors during this time. Through a painstaking investigation over
several weeks, we finally uncovered the cause of this: initiating a
subtransaction via the SAVEPOINT SQL query while
a long transaction is in progress can wreak havoc on database
replicas. Thus launched a race, which we recently completed, to
eliminate all SAVEPOINT queries from our code. Here&#x27;s what happened,
how we discovered the problem, and what we did to fix it.
The symptoms begin
On June 24th, we noticed that our CI/CD runners service reported a high
error rate:

A quick investigation revealed that database queries used to retrieve
CI/CD builds data were timing out and that the unprocessed b…</span>

                    <span>The semantic versioning (SemVer) specification can be
considered the de-facto standard for tracking software states during its
evolution. Unfortunately, in reality many languages/ecosystems practice &quot;SemVer versioning&quot; and have not adopted
the standard as-is; instead we can find many different semantic versioning
flavors that are not necessarily compatible with the original SemVer spec. SemVer Versioning has
led to the creation of a variety of different semantic versioning schemes.

feature that automatically detects vulnerabilities in the dependencies of a

Why consider special configuration?
While Sidekiq (both in general, and in a GitLab deployment) will usually just work most of the time, there can be some sharp edges and limits. Raw scale is a clear and obvious driver for needing to take action, and although it may be fine to simply scale out multiple Sidekiq nodes each listening to all the queues, at some point:
The uniqueness of workload distribution and job characteristics may require dedicated workers, either sharded on job attributes (as for GitLab.com), or specific workers (based on yo…</span>

                    <span>Effectively communicating a customer’s private needs to product teams is essential to a product’s success, but it can be a tricky undertaking.
Teams can face several challenges in communicating and tracking customers&#x27; requests, including protecting customer confidentiality, tracking priority and progress, and making sure the product team is getting actionable feedback that can be incorporated into product milestones.
This blog post shares GitLab&#x27;s best practices and lessons learned, as well as a video conversation between GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij and Fleet CEO Mike McNeil.
In line with GitLab&#x27;s open core model and transparency value, our product roadmap is public and the product team uses public issue trackers for feature requests and to plan the work. Because the issues are public, custo…</span>

                    <span>If every company is a software company, how do you stand out from the crowd when it comes to attracting developer talent and filling DevOps jobs?
There’s a well-known, and worldwide, shortage of software developers, especially those with expertise in DevOps. Worse still, demand for those roles is accelerating rapidly: The US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts employment opportunities for devs and testers will increase 22% between 2020 and 2030. That growth rate means nearly 190,000 net new developer/QA/test jobs will be opening each year, according to the BLS.
That’s all a long way of saying things are tough out there. Organizations looking to expand, or even just maintain, their DevOps jobs momentum have to find unique ways to stand out from the crowd because, as many surveys have shown,…</span>

                    <span>Today we are releasing version 13.12.12 for GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.
This version resolves a number of regressions and bugs in
the 13.12 release and
prior versions.
GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition
Derive virtual storage&#x27;s filesystem id from its name
Allow Raspberry Pi builds on Graviton
Stop pinning versions of perl related packages in UBI images
Important notes on upgrading
This version does not include any new migrations, and for multi-node deployments, should not require any downtime.
Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-reconfigure file,
which is only used for updates.

Access to GitLab Premium and Ultimate features is granted by a paid subscription.

                    <span>The earlier a feature or process is introduced in the multi-step software development lifecycle (SDLC), the more likely it is to be fully integrated into the product.
It&#x27;s well documented how security can shift left using a DevOps platform, so it&#x27;s time to make the case that accessbility needs to be thought about earlier (and, clearly, a DevOps platform can facilitate that too). Although there are laws that require applications to meet certain accessibility requirements, which opens an application up to a broader user base, rarely is accessibility considered a core product requirement. Instead, it is just a test tacked on at the end instead of being built into the DevOps platform process.

                    <span>Fostering better, more meaningful collaboration is an integral part of DevOps and a key part of what GitLab, the complete DevOps Platform, unlocks for developers and their teams. While many developers or engineers feel more comfortable working locally on their machines and spend a majority of their time using a CLI to push code changes, with GitLab you can also use the Web Editor or Web IDE to collaborate and edit content in a much easier, faster, and approachable way.
Starting in GitLab 14.2, editing Markdown content in the Web Editor or Web IDE just got even better.
