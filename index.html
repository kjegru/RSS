                    <span>Today we are releasing versions 14.2.2, 14.1.4, and 14.0.9 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE).
These versions contain important security fixes, and we strongly recommend that all GitLab installations be upgraded to one of these versions immediately.
GitLab releases patches for vulnerabilities in dedicated security releases. There are two types of security releases: a monthly, scheduled security release, released a week after the feature release (which deploys on the 22nd of each month), and ad-hoc security releases for critical vulnerabilities. For more information, you can visit our security FAQ. You can see all of our regular and security release blog posts here. In addition, the issues detailing each vulnerability are made public on our issue tracker 30 days a…</span>

Hackers are no longer just attacking the bits and bytes of source code that go into our products, but also the development, testing, and build infrastructure tools that are used to build these products.
Even if you believe your company is at low risk of an attack, it&#x27;s also important to think about your customers. Businesses with high profile customers – like government agencies or large, multinational corporations that use your products – might have attackers target them by hacking your company, or more specifically, the software you provide them.

It provides a handy packaging mechanism, new versions of software, and a quick and predictable release cycle – all while being distributed using a minimal image size. It&#x27;s used by many very popular container images, for example docker:dind,
widely used in GitLab CI/CD workloads handling container
images building and management in the jobs.
On June 15, 2021, Alpine Linux released version 3.14. As documented in the release notes, changes in the musl library require
an updated version of runc or updated version of
Docker for the Alpine 3.14-based images to work properly.

                    <span>Today we are releasing version 14.0.8 for GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.
This version resolves a number of regressions and bugs in
the 14.0 release and
prior versions.
GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition
Revert backfill on ci_build_trace_sections
Resolve &quot;operator does not exist: integer[] || bigint in app/models/namespace/traversal_hierarchy.rb&quot;
Fix Sidekiq workers delete each other&#x27;s metrics
Geo 2.0 Regression - Add ability to remove primary
Backport fix for flaky spec to 14.0
Important notes on upgrading
This version includes a post deploy migration. For multi-node deployments, it should not require any downtime.
Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-reconfigure file,
which is only used for updates.

                    <span>GitLab CI/CD technology has historically divided a pipeline into stages based on the typical development workflow. Now that GitLab 14.2 has launched, users can speed up cycle times by using the needs command to write a complete CI/CD pipeline with every job in the single stage. In fact, you can omit stages completely and have a &quot;stageless&quot; pipeline that executes entirely based on the needs dependencies.
Understanding stages
In GitLab CI/CD, you use stages to group jobs based on the development workflow and control the order of execution for CI/CD jobs.
Pipelines execute each stage in order, where all jobs in a single stage run in parallel. After a stage completes, the pipeline moves on to execute the next stage and runs those jobs, and the process continues like this until the pipeline com…</span>

                    <span>World-class CI/CD comes as a part of the GitLab DevOps Platform to help streamline how development teams build, test, and deploy their apps. GitLab Runner is the execution engine that &quot;does the work,&quot; enabling you, as a developer, to run fast, scalable CI/CD pipelines on your on-premises infrastructure or the cloud. Historically, Apple developers on GitLab SaaS had to set up runners on their own macOS systems to execute CI/CD workflows, introducing additional cost and operational overhead. As organizations and teams develop more apps for the Apple ecosystem, the need to create and deploy quickly becomes more important.

                    <span>Today we are releasing version 14.2.1 for GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.
This version resolves a number of regressions and bugs in
this month&#x27;s 14.2 release and
prior versions.
GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition
Adding upgrade messaging for PK migrations
Don&#x27;t override vulnerability feedback UUID anymore
Reorder vulnerability check criteria
Fix &quot;getAction is undefined&quot; bug
Drop un-used db/ci_migrate symlink
Fix migration NameError in rails env helper
Bump Container Registry to v3.9.0-gitlab
Important notes on upgrading
This version does not include any new migrations, and for multi-node deployments, should not require any downtime.
Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-reconfigure file,
which is only used for updates.

Today these supply chains are under attack, with malicious actors jeopardizing the sensitive data of millions of users through attacks on the public and private sectors.
After public and federal entities were targeted in some high-profile supply chain attacks, the United States government released an executive order with plans to improve the security posture of the nation when it comes to software supply chains.

Application scaling concerns can be handled by cloud services that are purpose designed, rigorously tested, and continually improved.

There are benefits to both the largest fleets and single instance runners.
Embedded in this article is a YouTube video that demonstrates the deployment of 100 GitLab runners on Amazon EC2 Spot compute in less than 10 minutes using less than 10 clicks. The video also shows updating this entire fleet in under 10 minutes to emphasize the time savings of built-in maintenace.

Turning back time a bit, what exactly is Phabricator? Built on the concept of web-based applications, Phabricator enables developers to collaborate with code reviews, repository browser, change monitoring, bug tracking and wiki. On May 29, 2021, Phacility, the maintainer and sponsor of Phabricator announced end-of-life and stopped maintaining Phabricator.
GitLab co-founder and CEO, Sid Sijbrandij gives credit to Phabricator on HackerNews:
Phabricator was an inspiration to me when starting GitLab. It is shutting down now. Many of its features were years ahead of its time and there was a lot of humor in the product. As a tribute to it shall we add Clowcoptarize as a w…</span>

In this third blog post, we’ll also dig deep into how to use a push-based approach, but this time our focus will be on the integrations of Terraform, AWS ECS, and AWS EC2 in GitOps flows. This approach may be preferable when using infrastructure components that aren&#x27;t Kubernetes, such as VMs, physical devices, and cloud-provider services.
Similar to Ansible – an agentless IT automation solution – Terraform can be leveraged by the scripting capabilities of GitLab to shape your infrastructure. GitLab also provides out-of-the-box integrations with Terraform, such as GitLab-man…</span>

                    <span>Today we are releasing version 13.12.10 for GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.
This version resolves a number of regressions and bugs in
May&#x27;s 13.12 release and
prior versions.
GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition
Available in GitLab Free, Premium, and Ultimate:
Fix: Sidekiq workers delete each other&#x27;s metrics
Do not create audit event for failed logins on read-only DB
Fix validation method regarding MIME type keys
Resolve &quot;operator does not exist&quot; in app/models/namespace/traversal_hierarchy.rb
gitlab-rails: checks/postgresql detect silent NoDatabaseError
Adding -ubi8 to version to find UBI images
Important notes on upgrading
This version does not include any new migrations, and for multi-node deployments, should not require any downtime.
Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-reconfigure file,
which is only used for updates.
Updating
To update, check out our update page.
GitLab subscriptions
Access to GitLab Premium and Ultimate features is granted by a paid subscription.
Alternatively, sign up for GitLab.com
to use GitLab&#x27;s own infrastructure.</span>

                    <span>At GitLab, we believe that remote work at scale will define not only the future of work, but the future of living. We created REMOTE by GitLab to bring together the remote work community and answer the questions many companies are asking: &quot;How do we do this, and what&#x27;s next?&quot;
We heard from some of the top leaders in remote work, from large companies that made the decision to leave the office behind, to teams of experts who have been studying the organizational design for years.
We share five lessons from the REMOTE by GitLab event that your team can apply to uplevel your remote practices and culture.
Set guiding principles for your remote transition (and stick to them)
As you navigate the changes that come with implementing remote-first practices, it&#x27;s important to have a set of values and…</span>

                    <span>Companies in all industries and sectors have significantly invested in digital transformation and increased their software development capabilities. GitLab delivers modern DevOps with a complete DevOps platform. However, some organizations require self-managed GitLab and GitLab Runners, which creates added costs for hosting and running GitLab infrastructure. Our latest cost analysis and performance benchmarks show that customers can realize cost savings of up to 23% and performance gains of up to 36% by deploying the GitLab application and GitLab Runner on the Arm-based Graviton2 when compared to the x86 based M5/C5 EC2 instances.

                    <span>UBS, the largest truly global wealth manager, uses GitLab to power DevCloud, a single DevOps Platform that allows for a cloud-based, service-oriented, software development lifecycle.
&quot;GitLab is a fundamental part of DevCloud,&quot; said Rick Carey, Group Chief Technology Officer at UBS. &quot;We wouldn&#x27;t be able to have that seamless experience without GitLab. It allowed us to pull ahead of many of our competitors, and break down the barriers between coding, testing, and deployment.&quot;
During GitLab Virtual Commit 2021, Rick and Eric Johnson, Chief Technology Officer at GitLab, talked about how building DevCloud on GitLab&#x27;s DevOps Platform allowed UBS to increase their development velocity, lower their infrastructure costs, and increase collaboration between engineers and non-engineering teams worldwi…</span>

                    <span>DevOps has evolved since its infancy, over a decade ago. Swiss developmental psychologist Jean Piaget believed human cognitive development has four stages (sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational). Through each of these stages, the human mind obtains new knowledge while building and modifying memories to inform one&#x27;s understanding of the world around them.
In the same way that people go through stages as they grow, markets and industries also go through stages of development. Over the years, DevOps has grown into a mature, business-critical practice.
As the DevOps industry expanded, so did the number and complexity of tool-project integrations within an organization. This was the result of three developments in DevOps:
