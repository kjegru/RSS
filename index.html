                    <span>As usual when the Linux 5.15 merge window began wrapping up, I set out to dive into its performance to see what is in store for this next version of the kernel and whether there was any regressions or other performance changes worth noting. Linux 5.15 overall has been in good shape for the &quot;-rc1&quot; state except noticing that code compilation workloads were taking longer on multiple Linux 5.15-rc1-running systems than Linux 5.14 or prior. Seeing it across multiple systems and a very real-world regression, it was worth bisecting and looking closer so here are the details.</span>

                    <span>Deployment automation is essential for any company involved in software development to stay competitive. QPage, a company that provides an end-to-end sourcing and recruitment solution for SMEs, realized it quickly and migrated to GitLab’s DevOps Platform to accelerate their deployment process.
We spoke with Pouya Lotfi, the co-founder of QPage, to see how they use GitLab at QPage and how it has helped the company.
Why GitLab?
QPage was initially using a local bespoke CI/CD for about the first two months, but they soon realized they needed a more professional DevOps Platform system. Because Pouya and the team at QPage had already used GitLab at a previous employer, they knew it would be the right fit. So, they didn’t consider other options and opted for GitLab straight away.

                    <span>When using infrastructure as code (IaC) on a public cloud provider, it&#x27;s important to use tags and labels to organize your IaC using their complementary services. Terratag, an open source project developed by env0, can be used with Terraform and placed on top of the GitLab CI/CD platform, making tagging and labeling IaC easier and more efficient.
GitLab and Terraform make it easy to tag and label infrastructure as code.
Inside your toolbox
GitLab the industry&#x27;s leading DevOps platform. Not long ago, we announced the ability to control Terraform deployments, remote state management, private module registry, and merge request integration for Terraform. This gives users a range of solutions for running CI/CD for Terraform code and managing it on a large scale.
Terraform is the most widely ado…</span>

                    <span>As a GitLab customer, Weet has fully invested in the premise of &quot;Iterate faster, innovate together.&quot; Weet has a low tolerance for processes that don&#x27;t keep pace with the way they develop and launch. One important process that was slowing the business down – localizing their app.
Localization is a key way to drive growth and accelerate product adoption. When done poorly, localization or l10n, as it&#x27;s commonly known, can slow down your development process, introduce bugs, and make it cumbersome to launch updates. When done right, teams can smooth out the process and continuously localize their app. We unpack how Weet conquered its localization problems using GitLab and Lokalise.

                    <span>The GitLab Kubernetes Agent (agentk) is an active in-cluster component for solving GitLab and Kubernetes integration tasks in a secure and cloud native way. The agentk communicates to the GitLab Kubernetes Agent Server (kas) to perform GitOps operations.
In many examples, we see the agent being deployed with global-level permissions on your cluster. There are use cases where we want to reduce the scope of what agentk has access to. In this guide I will provide information on deploying agentk on your cluster, limiting what namespaces it can access, as well as using it to deploy your applications.

                    <span>As more organizations adopt open source software, DevOps and cloud computing, teams are moving towards a hybrid approach to application development and deployments. This is a particular challenge for siloed mainframe development teams that typically work within their own development tools – and those tools are are not the same ones used by their distributed developer counterparts. These disparate toolsets are not integrated between build, package, test, and deploy steps. GitLab aims to provide a unified enterprise-wide DevOps platform with enhanced support for IBM z/OS® applications. Here are three critical areas to focus on that can help bridge the gap between mainframe and &quot;modern&quot; DevOps development.

                    <span>This is the second in a series of blog posts looking at the challenges of code review and the ways a DevOps platform can help. Read the first post.
Code review can be one of the most deceivingly difficult things in delivering software faster. Given the high stakes involved, we&#x27;ve made some key additions to our DevOps Platform that focus on making the code review process as seamless and effective as possible. We believe the number one way to make code reviews effective is to provide context. Too often we think of code reviews as only &quot;reading&quot; and commenting on others&#x27; code - but what a good code reviewer does is understand the entire context of the proposed change. Context-driven code reviews should include factors like the issue that spurred on the change, how the change impacts non-obvio…</span>

                    <span>In the struggle to release safer software faster, development teams are increasingly choosing a DevOps platform to help them get there. In our 2021 Global DevSecOps Survey we asked respondents what their DevOps practices included and a &quot;DevOps platform&quot; was among the top four choices, right next to CI/CD, test automation, and DevSecOps.
We&#x27;re of course bullish on the idea of a DevOps platform, but we&#x27;re far from alone. Here&#x27;s a fresh look at how the data – and the customers – support the optimistic trajectory of a DevOps platform.
DevOps is hot
The DevOps market was worth $6 billion in 2020, according to Global Industry Analysts, and five-year growth forecasts range from $17 billion to as much as $23 billion, depending on the firm.

                    <span>In summer 2021, the Vulnerability Research and Static Analysis
teams launched the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project: Write vulnerability detection rules for SAST.
For this project, we built and implemented a framework to helps transition GitLab away from our current SAST tools over to Semgrep. Semgrep is a language-agnostic SAST tool that is gaining popularity in CI/CD environments.
Before replacing an analyzer with the corresponding Semgrep configuration (called rule-sets), we need to ensure that they are equivalent – in that they yield the same set of findings.
For this purpose, we built a testing framework that helps us assess the quality of a Semgrep rule-set. This framework has been used to guide the replacement of flawfinder, a C/C++ analyzer with a corresponding Semgrep rule-set.…</span>

No one’s hacking their way into my workstation, that’s for sure.
But my experience working as a hacker myself has shown me that the opposite is often true. Those of us who are more technical are often much more vulnerable to an attack due to the complexity of our working environments.

                    <span>When making a list of the reasons to consider moving to a DevOps Platform, don&#x27;t forget about code review, a critical piece of the process that&#x27;s also an incredible source of frustration and delays to developers and their teams.
In our 2021 Global DevSecOps Survey, respondents told us code quality was the number one reason they chose DevOps. But, when asked what was most likely to delay a product release, code review – vital to code quality – was one of the top four culprits (the others were testing, planning and code development). 
The fact that code review is a pain point is hardly surprising, given that it can often require context-switching, communication, collaboration, and of course subject matter expertise. At a time when it&#x27;s never been more urgent to release secure code as quickly…</span>

                    <span>In a recent blog post about the importance of a DevOps Platform, GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij outlined four phases through which organizations frequently travel as their practice matures. It’s a painful journey we see again and again when we meet new customers. It spans every industry and every company size, and it’s the most mature DevOps teams with the most at stake who’ve felt the most pain. 
Historically, if you wanted DevOps to work, you had to be prepared to pay for it. Just managing the backbone of DevOps – the toolchain -– has been a grind. Your “Jenkins Team,” your “GitHub Team,” or even, as one of our customers described, your “Duct Tape Team” (designed to hold it all together and patch holes), added no end value beyond keeping everything from falling apart.

                    <span>Sidekiq in GitLab works perfectly well out-of-the-box in most use cases, but it requires a little more attention in larger deployments or other specialized cases. We&#x27;ve learned a lot about how to configure Sidekiq in large deployments by maintaining GitLab.com – one of the largest instances of GitLab in existence. We added some critical features to GitLab.com in the past year to make it easier to configure Sidekiq in a manner more consistent with the maintainer&#x27;s guidance, having strayed from this path for some time.
We are publishing two blog posts devoted to this topic. In this first post, we will unpack how we configured Sidekiq for GitLab.com, and in our second post, we will explain how to apply this to your GitLab instance.

Over the summer, student interns work on a project with an open source organization and are closely mentored by the developers of the open source project. More than 200 organizations participated this year.

                    <span>Today we are releasing versions 14.2.2, 14.1.4, and 14.0.9 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE).
These versions contain important security fixes, and we strongly recommend that all GitLab installations be upgraded to one of these versions immediately.
GitLab releases patches for vulnerabilities in dedicated security releases. There are two types of security releases: a monthly, scheduled security release, released a week after the feature release (which deploys on the 22nd of each month), and ad-hoc security releases for critical vulnerabilities. For more information, you can visit our security FAQ. You can see all of our regular and security release blog posts here. In addition, the issues detailing each vulnerability are made public on our issue tracker 30 days a…</span>

                    <span>If there is one thing that recent cyberattacks at companies such as SolarWinds, Codecov, and Kaseya have taught us, it&#x27;s that software build pipelines are being targeted for attacks more than ever before. Hackers are no longer just attacking the bits and bytes of source code that go into our products, but also the development, testing, and build infrastructure tools that are used to build these products.
Even if you believe your company is at low risk of an attack, it&#x27;s also important to think about your customers. Businesses with high profile customers – like government agencies or large, multinational corporations that use your products – might have attackers target them by hacking your company, or more specifically, the software you provide them.

                    <span>Alpine Linux distribution is the base OS used by many Linux container images. It provides a handy packaging mechanism, new versions of software, and a quick and predictable release cycle – all while being distributed using a minimal image size. It&#x27;s used by many very popular container images, for example docker:dind,
widely used in GitLab CI/CD workloads handling container
images building and management in the jobs.
On June 15, 2021, Alpine Linux released version 3.14. As documented in the release notes, changes in the musl library require
an updated version of runc or updated version of
Docker for the Alpine 3.14-based images to work properly.
Software products across the computer industry have started migrating their Alpine Linux-based container images to 3.14 since it includes significa…</span>

                    <span>Today we are releasing version 14.0.8 for GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.
This version resolves a number of regressions and bugs in
the 14.0 release and
prior versions.
GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition
Revert backfill on ci_build_trace_sections
Resolve &quot;operator does not exist: integer[] || bigint in app/models/namespace/traversal_hierarchy.rb&quot;
Fix Sidekiq workers delete each other&#x27;s metrics
Geo 2.0 Regression - Add ability to remove primary
Backport fix for flaky spec to 14.0
Important notes on upgrading
This version includes a post deploy migration. For multi-node deployments, it should not require any downtime.
Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-reconfigure file,
which is only used for updates.

                    <span>GitLab CI/CD technology has historically divided a pipeline into stages based on the typical development workflow. Now that GitLab 14.2 has launched, users can speed up cycle times by using the needs command to write a complete CI/CD pipeline with every job in the single stage. In fact, you can omit stages completely and have a &quot;stageless&quot; pipeline that executes entirely based on the needs dependencies.
Understanding stages
In GitLab CI/CD, you use stages to group jobs based on the development workflow and control the order of execution for CI/CD jobs.
Pipelines execute each stage in order, where all jobs in a single stage run in parallel. After a stage completes, the pipeline moves on to execute the next stage and runs those jobs, and the process continues like this until the pipeline com…</span>
