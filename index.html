                    <span>This is the first in a series of three blog posts where we discuss threat modeling and how we’re using it at GitLab to help secure our product, our company, and most importantly our customer’s data. As usual, we’re doing things a bit differently, but when you hear why it will make a lot of sense.
Threat modeling
Let’s start with the basics, what is threat modeling?
Threat modeling is the process of risk assessment for a particular project, asset, procedure, or product. While it can apply to nearly any established or new procedure, it seems to most often get applied to software. For GitLab, this would mainly apply to our source code.
As assessing risk has historically been the domain of the security department of most organizations, the threat modeling process has been nearly exclusively ha…</span>

                    <span>While looking at GitLab&#x27;s Gitpod integration, I came across two rather critical flaws in Gitpod itself. In this post, I&#x27;ll cover the process of identifying the vulnerabilities and some background on Gitpod. The more critical issue was fixed and the fix was pushed to production by the Gitpod team in less than five hours from my initial report. Huge kudos to the Gitpod team for that quick turnaround.
What is Gitpod?
First, let&#x27;s see what Gitpod actually is – taken straight from gitpod.io:
Spin up fresh, automated dev environments for each task, in the cloud, in seconds.
That quote sums it up really well. You can login to Gitpod with your GitLab, GitHub, or Bitbucket account and then use a pretty full-blown, web-based development environment to work on your code, run tests, or even spin up se…</span>

                    <span>Today we are releasing version 14.0.5 for GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.
This version resolves a number of regressions and bugs in
this month&#x27;s 14.0 release and
prior versions.
GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition
Resolve &quot;404 for package details link under Infrastructure Registry for projects nested under 2 group levels&quot;
Resolve &quot;Terraform module usage instructions are incorrect&quot;
Add documentation for boards epic create
Initialize conversion of ci_builds_metadata.id for bigint migration
Fix git clone for projects with a trailing dot over HTTP
Do not create audit event for failed logins on read-only DB
Add prefix to autocomplete path
Return empty strings for Jira links when URL is not set
Fix libmagic not being able to find magic files
Important notes on upgrading
This version does not include any new migrations, and for multi-node deployments, should not require any downtime.
Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-reconfigure file,
which is only used for updates.
Updating

These versions contain important security fixes, and we strongly recommend that all GitLab installations be upgraded to one of these versions immediately.
GitLab releases patches for vulnerabilities in dedicated security releases. There are two types of security releases: a monthly, scheduled security release, released a week after the feature release (which deploys on the 22nd of each month), and ad-hoc security releases for critical vulnerabilities. For more information, you can visit our security FAQ. You can see all of our regular and security release blog posts here.

                    <span>Today we are releasing version 14.0.3 for GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.
This version resolves a number of regressions and bugs in
this month&#x27;s 14.0 release and
prior versions.
GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition
Reintroduce recursive_approach_for_all_projects default-enabled
Fix pages deployment storage migration
Fix frequent items timestamps not updated
Fix bug where Milestone page led to console error
Fix broken Time Tracking Reports on Issuable sidebar
Geo - Fix state value in the lfs_object_registry table
Revert a 14.0 change in the deployments API
DevOps Adoption - ensure displayNamespaceId is included
Geo - Move migration to a pre-deployment migration
Run batched migrations on self-managed instances
Fix deploy keys not working with LFS auth check
Repository: Fix repo replication with transactions
Repository: Fix excessive voting in CreateRepositoryFromBundle
Important notes on upgrading
This version does not include any new migrations, and for multi-node deployments, should not require any downtime.
Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-reconfigure file,
which is only used for updates.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/06/28/package-key-extension/">
                  <div class="article-summary-box-inner">
                    <span class="article-reading-time">(5 min)</span>
                    <span>GitLab uses a GPG key to sign all Omnibus packages created within the CI pipelines to insure that the packages have not been tampered with. This key is seperate from the repository metadata signing key used by package managers and the GPG signing key for the GitLab Runner. The Omnibus package signing key is set to expire on July 1, 2021 and will be extended to expire on July 1, 2022 instead.
Why are we extending the deadline?
The Omnibus package signing key&#x27;s expiration is extended each year to comply with GitLab security policies and to limit the exposure should the key become compromised. The key&#x27;s expiration is extended instead of rotating to a new key to be less disruptive for users that do verify package integrity checks prior to installing the package.
What do I need to do?
The only action that needs to be taken is to update your copy of the package signing key if you validate the signatures on the Omnibus packages that GitLab distributes.
The package signing key is not the key that signs the repository metadata used by the OS package managers like apt or yum. Unless you are specifically verifying the package signatures or have configured your package manager to verify the package signatures, there is no action needed on your part to continue installing Omnibus packages.
More information concerning verification of the package signatures
is available in the Omnibus documentation. If you just need to refresh a copy
of the public key, then you can find it on any of the GPG keyservers by
searching for support@gitlab.com or using the key ID of
DBEF 8977 4DDB 9EB3 7D9F  C3A0 3CFC F9BA F27E AB47. Alternatively you could
download it directly from packages.gitlab.com using the URL:
https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/nightly-builds/gpgkey/gitlab-nightly-builds-3D645A26AB9FBD22.pub.gpg


What do I do if I still have problems?
Please open an issue in the omnibus-gitlab issue tracker.</span>

                    <span>In the previous post, titled 3 ways to approach GitOps, we discussed the many benefits and options that GitLab supports for fulfilling the GitOps requirements of customers, whose IT environments are composed of heterogeneous technologies and infrastructures. This post is a 3-part series, in which we delve deeper into these options. In this first part, we cover the pull-based or agent-based approach.
About a pull-based or agent-based approach
In this approach, an agent is installed in your infrastructure components to pull changes whenever there is a drift from the desired configuration, which resides in GitLab. Although the infrastructure components could be anything from a physical server or router to a VM or a database, we will focus on a Kubernetes cluster in this section.

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)

                    <span>The DevOps era began with a big idea – dissolve silos to deliver better software, faster. In the transition from classic software paradigms, DIY DevOps toolchains were built with parts that were never designed to work together. That DIY DevOps era left many trapped in new silos, without visibility, and mired in maintenance. Business outcomes suffered as the potential of DevOps was never fully realized.
The next iteration of DevOps
There is a better way to build software. GitLab 14 delivers modern DevOps with a complete DevOps platform, for a streamlined experience that unleashes the power of DevOps.

                    <span>When we think of everything released in the year since GitLab 13.0, we could not be more proud of our community and our team. This month, we celebrate our release of GitLab 14.0 by first taking a step back.
Together, we’ve made so much progress over the last year that we want to talk about everything it took to get to GitLab 14.
We use semantic versioning so a point release, like 14.0, represents everything new in this month. GitLab 14 is the culmination of the past year. Even more than that, GitLab 14 represents the future of GitLab, and the future of DevOps.
With GitLab 14, teams of all sizes are moving from maintaining DIY DevOps toolchains to adopting modern DevOps. GitLab 14 is a complete DevOps platform with security embedded in its DNA, visibility and insights enabled by its single …</span>

                    <span>We recently discovered a Usage Ping  configuration bug for self-managed instances and have since published a patch release to fix the bug. The issue affects the ability to disable Usage Ping for self-managed GitLab via text configuration files, resulting in the collection and transmission of Usage Ping events from the instance. This bug affects any instance running GitLab version 9.3 to version 13.12.3, and was patched in 13.12.4.
What does this mean for existing users?
This issue does not affect customers who have disabled Usage Ping via the user interface or any users of our SaaS product.
You can check your instance configuration settings to see if this issue may have affected you. We’ve published more detailed instructions here.
What should I do?
Since we do not collect any configuration data from your instance, we have no way to detect if you unintentionally shared data with GitLab. Out of an abundance of caution, we ask that you fill out this form if you suspect that Usage Ping data was shared after taking steps to opt-out in your GitLab configuration file. We will purge data from our systems and follow up with confirmation.
Please share your questions and feedback with us on the community forum.</span>

                    <span>CI/CD pipelines are the preeminent solution to mitigate potential risks while integrating code changes into the repository. CI/CD pipelines help isolate the impact of potential errors, making it easier to fix them. Top that with a tool that provides effective visibility into the running tasks and there you have a recipe for success.
Since the primary purpose of CI/CD pipelines is to speed up the development process and provide value to the end user faster, there&#x27;s always room to make the process more efficient. This blog post unpacks some strategies that can help you get the most out of your pipeline definition in GitLab CI.

                    <span>Today we are releasing version 13.12.5 for GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.
This version resolves a number of regressions and bugs in
this month&#x27;s 13.12 release and
prior versions.
GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition
Available in GitLab Free, Premium, and Ultimate:
Only update required instance ci template when the parameter is present
Fix Password expired error on git fetch via SSH for LDAP user
Advanced Search Settings page does not load if the ES url is unreachable
Important notes on upgrading
This version does not include any new migrations, and for multi-node deployments, should not require any downtime.
Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-reconfigure file,
which is only used for updates.
Updating
To update, check out our update page.

                    <span>GitLab uses a GPG key to sign official GitLab Runner packages. We recently became aware of an instance where this key and other tokens used to distribute official GitLab Runner packages and binaries were not secured according to GitLab’s security policies.
We have not found any evidence of unauthorized modification of the packages or access to the services storing them. Our team has audited and investigated integrity hashes, bucket logs and versioning, and pipeline history and concluded that the unauthorized modification of any packages is exceedingly unlikely.
Out of an abundance of caution, the GPG key used for release signing and verification has been rotated along with all other tokens that were improperly secured.
If you use GitLab.com shared runners, this does not impact you.

                    <span>Last year I wrote about how the Quality Engineering Enablement team was building up the performance testing of GitLab with the GitLab Performance Tool (GPT). Last year, the biggest challenge with performance testing wasn&#x27;t so much the testing but rather setting up the right large scale GitLab environments to test against.
Like any server application, deploying at scale is challenging. That&#x27;s why we built another toolkit that automates the deployment of GitLab at scale: The GitLab Environment Toolkit (GET).

Internally called the &quot;Performance Environment Builder&quot; (PEB), GET grew alongside GPT as we continued to expand our performance testing efforts. Over time we built a toolkit that was quite capable in its own right of deploying GitLab at scale, which is wh…</span>
