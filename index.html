                    <span>It’s October 2021, and we have quite a few treats in store. In addition to celebrating the 10th anniversary of the GitLab open source project, GitLab Inc. will be participating in Hacktoberfest, an event dedicated to increasing contributions to open source projects that&#x27;s now in its eighth year. This has been widely requested by the open source community for years, so we’re thrilled to see GitLab support rolled out!
Thanks to DigitalOcean, the organization behind Hacktoberfest, people can now contribute to open source projects that are hosted on GitLab.com.
It’s easy, sign up on the Hacktoberfest website using your GitLab account and explore the available projects to contribute.
Project maintainers who want their projects to participate in Hacktoberfest should follow the steps described on…</span>

                    <span>Today we are releasing version 14.3.2 GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.
This version resolves a number of regressions and bugs in
the 14.3 release and
prior versions.
GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition
Add OR REPLACE when creating function
Top 7 Highlight items for 14.3
Update GitLab Shell to v13.21.1
Remove feature flag check for candece finder
Remove unexpected FK prior to swapping columns
Allow ee images to be skipped on CE pipelines
Bump kas to v14.3.3
Important notes on upgrading
These versions do not include any new migrations, and for multi-node deployments, should not require any downtime.
Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-reconfigure file,
which is only used for updates.
Updating
To update, check out our update page.

Access to GitLab Premium and Ultimate features is granted by a paid subscription.

While PipeWire is already in use for screencasting/recording under Wayland and working with Flatpak&#x27;ed applications, recently much of PipeWire&#x27;s focus has been on addressing the use-cases of JACK and PulseAudio on the sound side. Now that the audio support is in quite good shape, Red Hat engineers are back to focusing on improvements to the video support...</span>

                    <span>The GitLab user profile contains information about you and your GitLab activity. You can select what information to display.
We recently added a few new settings to make you user profile more personal:
User pronouns
User pronunciation guides
User local times
User pronouns
You can now set pronouns to your GitLab user profile. The pronoun appears:
Next to your user name in your public profile.
On the snapshot view of your user profile when someone hovers over your name on an issue or
merge request.
Besides being more inclusive, GitLab wants to help you use the correct pronouns when replying
to comments to respect people&#x27;s identity. You can:
Decide whether or not to add pronouns to your profile.
Self-identify and enter whatever pronouns you want, without having to select from a pre-defined list.
Read more about adding
pronouns to your profile.
User pronunciation
You can now add a pronunciation guide to your user profile. In distributed teams where team
members are from different countries, it can be difficult to determine how to say someone&#x27;s
name correctly. You can now help people know how to pronounce your name.
Read more about adding a
pronunciation guide to your profile.
User local time
Your local time is now displayed on your profile. Previously, you could set your time
zone but your local time was not visible throughout GitLab. This improvement helps
others know when you are likely to be available.
Read more about adding a
local time zone to your profile.
Additional settings for user profiles
In the upcoming milestone, we are planning to add your timezone to the snapshot view of the GitLab user profile.
In GitLab, everyone can contribute. If you would like to see even
more additions to user profiles, you can:
Open an issue with your request.
Upvote an existing issue. Read more in our Users direction page.
Even code it yourself!

                    <span>For three years in a row, our Global DevSecOps Survey found testing was the number one reason (by large margins) for release delays. A lack of automated software testing, combined with too many manual tests conducted too late in the process, was a story told time after time, and it certainly was one without any kind of happy ending.
Despite the undeniable progress DevOps has brought to software development, integrating automated software testing into the lifecycle has remained an elusive goal for many teams. Here’s a look at why testing is such a difficult step to get right, and how an integrated DevOps Platform can bring much-needed structure to the process.
The state of automated software testing

                    <span>Linux kernel developers have been working tirelessly to squeeze more performance out of IO_uring and the block / I/O code in general. IO_uring lead developer Jens Axboe who also serves as the Linux block subsystem&#x27;s maintainer (among other roles and major contributions over the years) has used his system as a baseline for evaluating such kernel improvements. He&#x27;s now moved to using AMD Zen 3 while sticking to Intel Optane storage and is seeing a mighty speed boost out of AMD&#x27;s latest processors...</span>

                    <span>Since last June, we noticed the database on GitLab.com would
mysteriously stall for minutes, which would lead to users seeing 500
errors during this time. Through a painstaking investigation over
several weeks, we finally uncovered the cause of this: initiating a
subtransaction via the SAVEPOINT SQL query while
a long transaction is in progress can wreak havoc on database
replicas. Thus launched a race, which we recently completed, to
eliminate all SAVEPOINT queries from our code. Here&#x27;s what happened,
how we discovered the problem, and what we did to fix it.
The symptoms begin
On June 24th, we noticed that our CI/CD runners service reported a high
error rate:

                    <span>The semantic versioning (SemVer) specification can be
considered the de-facto standard for tracking software states during its
evolution. Unfortunately, in reality many languages/ecosystems practice &quot;SemVer versioning&quot; and have not adopted
the standard as-is; instead we can find many different semantic versioning
flavors that are not necessarily compatible with the original SemVer spec. SemVer Versioning has
led to the creation of a variety of different semantic versioning schemes.

                    <span>Configuring Sidekiq in your own deployment of GitLab is a little complicated, but entirely possible. In this blog post, we share how to set up Sidekiq for GitLab in special cases and at a large scale by sharing some exmaples that may be useful to you.
Why consider special configuration?
While Sidekiq (both in general, and in a GitLab deployment) will usually just work most of the time, there can be some sharp edges and limits. Raw scale is a clear and obvious driver for needing to take action, and although it may be fine to simply scale out multiple Sidekiq nodes each listening to all the queues, at some point:
The uniqueness of workload distribution and job characteristics may require dedicated workers, either sharded on job attributes (as for GitLab.com), or specific workers (based on yo…</span>

                    <span>Today we are releasing version 14.0.11 GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.
This version resolves a number of regressions and bugs in
the 14.0 release and
prior versions.
GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition
Derive virtual storage&#x27;s filesystem id from its name
Fix Elastic::MigrationWorker current_migration
Important notes on upgrading
These versions do not include any new migrations, and for multi-node deployments, should not require any downtime.
Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-reconfigure file,
which is only used for updates.

                    <span>If every company is a software company, how do you stand out from the crowd when it comes to attracting developer talent and filling DevOps jobs?
There’s a well-known, and worldwide, shortage of software developers, especially those with expertise in DevOps. Worse still, demand for those roles is accelerating rapidly: The US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts employment opportunities for devs and testers will increase 22% between 2020 and 2030. That growth rate means nearly 190,000 net new developer/QA/test jobs will be opening each year, according to the BLS.
That’s all a long way of saying things are tough out there. Organizations looking to expand, or even just maintain, their DevOps jobs momentum have to find unique ways to stand out from the crowd because, as many surveys have shown,…</span>

                    <span>The earlier a feature or process is introduced in the multi-step software development lifecycle (SDLC), the more likely it is to be fully integrated into the product.
It&#x27;s well documented how security can shift left using a DevOps platform, so it&#x27;s time to make the case that accessbility needs to be thought about earlier (and, clearly, a DevOps platform can facilitate that too). Although there are laws that require applications to meet certain accessibility requirements, which opens an application up to a broader user base, rarely is accessibility considered a core product requirement. Instead, it is just a test tacked on at the end instead of being built into the DevOps platform process.

                    <span>Fostering better, more meaningful collaboration is an integral part of DevOps and a key part of what GitLab, the complete DevOps Platform, unlocks for developers and their teams. While many developers or engineers feel more comfortable working locally on their machines and spend a majority of their time using a CLI to push code changes, with GitLab you can also use the Web Editor or Web IDE to collaborate and edit content in a much easier, faster, and approachable way.
Starting in GitLab 14.2, editing Markdown content in the Web Editor or Web IDE just got even better.

Important notes on upgrading
This version does not include any new migrations, and for multi-node deployments, should not require any downtime.
Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-reconfigure file,
which is only used for updates.

                    <span>Deployment automation is essential for any company involved in software development to stay competitive. QPage, a company that provides an end-to-end sourcing and recruitment solution for SMEs, realized it quickly and migrated to GitLab’s DevOps Platform to accelerate their deployment process.
We spoke with Pouya Lotfi, the co-founder of QPage, to see how they use GitLab at QPage and how it has helped the company.
Why GitLab?
QPage was initially using a local bespoke CI/CD for about the first two months, but they soon realized they needed a more professional DevOps Platform system. Because Pouya and the team at QPage had already used GitLab at a previous employer, they knew it would be the right fit. So, they didn’t consider other options and opted for GitLab straight away.

                    <span>When using infrastructure as code (IaC) on a public cloud provider, it&#x27;s important to use tags and labels to organize your IaC using their complementary services. Terratag, an open source project developed by env0, can be used with Terraform and placed on top of the GitLab CI/CD platform, making tagging and labeling IaC easier and more efficient.
GitLab and Terraform make it easy to tag and label infrastructure as code.
Inside your toolbox
GitLab the industry&#x27;s leading DevOps platform. Not long ago, we announced the ability to control Terraform deployments, remote state management, private module registry, and merge request integration for Terraform. This gives users a range of solutions for running CI/CD for Terraform code and managing it on a large scale.

                    <span>As a GitLab customer, Weet has fully invested in the premise of &quot;Iterate faster, innovate together.&quot; Weet has a low tolerance for processes that don&#x27;t keep pace with the way they develop and launch. One important process that was slowing the business down – localizing their app.
Localization is a key way to drive growth and accelerate product adoption. When done poorly, localization or l10n, as it&#x27;s commonly known, can slow down your development process, introduce bugs, and make it cumbersome to launch updates. When done right, teams can smooth out the process and continuously localize their app. We unpack how Weet conquered its localization problems using GitLab and Lokalise.

                    <span>The GitLab Kubernetes Agent (agentk) is an active in-cluster component for solving GitLab and Kubernetes integration tasks in a secure and cloud native way. The agentk communicates to the GitLab Kubernetes Agent Server (kas) to perform GitOps operations.
In many examples, we see the agent being deployed with global-level permissions on your cluster. There are use cases where we want to reduce the scope of what agentk has access to. In this guide I will provide information on deploying agentk on your cluster, limiting what namespaces it can access, as well as using it to deploy your applications.
